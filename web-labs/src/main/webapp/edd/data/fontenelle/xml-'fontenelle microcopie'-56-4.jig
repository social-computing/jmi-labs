THE MICROSCOPE. 
Bv Jons Mayaix, ]vs. 
Lecture I.&#8212;Dtlivered November 23, 
Okihix ok thk Microscope. 
The authors of text-books on the microscope 
are almost unanimous in implying that we 
cannot justly claim the microscope as a dis- 
tinctly modern invention, but that we owe St- 
at least in its simplest form, i.e., as a magni- 
fying lens&#8212; lo the ancients, who, if they did 
not directly transmit the instrument to us, so 
far notified it in their writing that ws arc 
bound to admit our obligations to them, and 
the utmost we can justly claim is the re- 
invention of the instrument, and its greater 
perfection. 

I venture to express my disagreement from 
these authors. After much consideration I 
have come to the conclusion that the micro- 
scope, as we know and employ it, is essentially 
a modem invention, hit upon, it may be 
accidentally, but hit upon at a period corres- 
ponding almost marvellously with the advent 
of the spirit of modern scientific research, 
when the need of such an instrument was, so 
to speak, most intensely felt by those pre- 
cursors of modern science who first struggled 
uut of the meshes ot the ancient empirical 
methods into the free air of experimental 
methods.

the evolution of the modern microscope ha* 
been a subject of special interest to me. 
Gradually a conviction has been formulated in 
my mind that the historians of the microscope 
have been on the whole too ready in tracking 
the invention of the instrument to ancient 
times, too anxious, as it has seemed to me, to 
claim antiquity and a continuo js history for it. 
I must, of course, except Prof. Harting, of 
Utrecht University, from any criticism on this 
poir.t, and must acknowledge the fairness and 
conspicuous ability with which he has sought 
to exhibit a general sketch of the history of the 
construction -a history which will he a land- 
mark as long as the microscope is used as an 
instrument of research. 

1 he question of the antiquity of the use of 
magnifying lenses was much discussed in 
former times, notably by La Hire, Molyneu- 
Fontenelle, Vettori, Robert Smith, I.ippert! 
Dutens, Lessing, Priestley. Montucla. and 
Lalande. By the diligence of these writers the 
various passap.es from ancient authors were 
collected and submitted to criticism, not 
always, as it would seem, in the spirit of can- 
dour. More recently, Wilde, Arago, Libri 
Harting, Poggendorff, and others, have dis- 
cussed the subject, dealing more or less with 
the original texts and the reasonings based 
upon them by modern critics. 

The original discussion was revived by M T 
H. Martin, in 1871, in his elaborate paper "Sur 
des instruments d'optique faussement attribues 
aux anciens par quelques savants modernes " 
in the "Bulletino- d. Bibliographia e di Stor'ia 
delle Sc.enre matematiche e fisiche, ' ' of Rome 
&gt;n which the original texts are minutely dis- 
cussed; and his conclusion is, that magnifying 
lenses were not known to the ancients, or, at 
least, were not used by them for any practical 
purpose. As my own views agree in the main 
with those of M. Martin. I have thought the 
present a favourable opportunity to summarise 

col.^^ K m J ranS,ati0ni USin * the mate ria's 
collected by him, and the inferences he based 

upon them in my own way, abbreviating his 
text or adding to it. The student s'.ould of 
course, consult the original for the details of 
evidence; what I here give is but a rough 
outline. " u &gt;&gt;"

crystal, such as were then obtainable at the 
apothecaries, and which, in the words of the 
play, were used for lighting a fire, and placing 
himself at a distance with th* crystal exposed 
to the sun, at the moment when the public 
officer is writingonthe wax tablet the declaration 
of the debt by the creditor, he will efface the 
writing by melting the wax on the tablet. This 
passage is sheer ridicule, composed in a spirit 
analogous to that of our own Swift when he 
introduces us to the professor in the Grand 
Academy of Lagado engaged "upon a project 
for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, 
whirh were tu be put in vials hermetically 
scaled, and let out to warm the air in in- 
clement summers. " That it is sheer ridicule 
is evident, for it is of a piece with a previous 
passage, where the same Strepsiad&#171;*s proposes 
to escape the monthly payment of the interest 
on debts, legally payable then at the time ot 
new moon, by buying a sorceress from 
Thessaly who should shut up the moon in a 
box, and so prevent the arrival of the dreaded 
date of settlement. From such a passage, 
then, no serious inference can properly be 
made that the use of magnifying lenses was 
known to Aristophanes, upwards of 400 years 

r..c. 

The elaer Pliny mentions that physicians 
cauterised by means of a globe of crystal 
{crystallina f&gt;ila). He does not inform us 
whether the globe was solid or hollow, though 
elsewhere he speaks of a globe of glass {vitria 
pila) filled with water and used likewise for 
cauterisation. 

Alexander, the commentator on Aristotle's 
"Meteorology," mentions that objects may 
be ignited by the heat of the sun passing 
through "a vase filled with cold water, with- 
out warming tne water in the vase," or at 
least without warming it sufficiently to account 
for the fire. 

Philopon, the Greek commentator on Aris- 
totle, Lactantius, and others, state, with more 
or less erroneous explanation, that water ex- 
posed to the sun will produce tire. 

These citations prove that the ancients 
knew the effects of burning-glasses acting by- 
refraction, though of the explanation they 
knew little or nothing. 

One ancient author, however, appears to 
have suspected the real nature of the phe- 
nomend-the optician Damicn, disciple of 
Hcliodorus Larissus. He refers to concave 
mirrors burning by reflexion, and then speaks 
of burning-glasses acting by refraction, stat- 
ing that through these glat,sei&gt; rays refracted 



and converging towards the same point ignite 
objects of a suitable nature placed there. But 
he gives no theory of this convergence, and 
says nothing of the form of the glasses, or of 
their curvatures. 

Nothing in the authors cited would indicate 
that they had any suspicion that these burning- 
glasses, acting by refraction, could be employed 
as magnifying lenses. 

With reference to the texts of ancient writers 
where the magnifying power is alluded to, 
Seneca (in the often cited passages from his 
"Qua?st. Nat." I., 6, 5 5) states that "letters, 
though small and indistinct, are seen enlarged 
and more distinct through a globe of glass filled 
with water," and that " fruit appears larger* 
when seen immersed in a vase of glass;" 
whence he concludes that all objects seen 
through water appear larger than they are. 
Similar statements appear in the writings of 
Philo Judaeus, Ptolemy, and others, down to 
Aulus Gellius. Seneca adds that " through 
water we cannot see objects accurately, nor 
assign to them their true situations." 

Several passages might be cited from 
Archimedes, Ptolemy, and others, to show that 
though they knew something of the action of 
refraction at plane surfaces as of water, yet of 
the refraction at curved surfaces they had no 
conceptioa. These writers do not appear to 
have thought that the form of the refractive body 
was of special importance ; they refer indis- 
criminately to the spherical form, or the disc, or 
the plane surface of the water, but not one of them 
speaks of the lenticular form. The passages 
where magnification is alluded to, show that 
they attributed the effect wholly to the nature 
of the water, or again to the nature of the glass 
or of transparent bodies in general, and never 
to the geometric forms or to imperfections in 
the curvatures of their surfaces. 

Further, we do not find in any ancient author 
mention of spectacles for long or short sigh! , 
or of magnifying lenses or microscopes. They 
mention mirrors burning by reflexion, and 
other instruments burning by refraction, con- 
sisting generally of spherical vases filled with 
water. Occasionally they speak of solid 
globes, and in one case th? discoid form is 
mentioned ; but in view of the notions they 
held with reference to vision through trans- 
parent bodies, it cannot properly be affirmed 

&#8226; Prof. Baden Powell remarks that " the dependence of 
thil [ma(rnification] on the lenticular form of the glass uscms 
to have been wholly unknown ; and this case wa&#187; confounded 
together with others, iu a way evincing a total absence of 
all conception of the cause." &#8226;* Hist, of Nat. Philos.," p. 6;&gt;

that they leally touched upon the theory of 
dioptric len*es, or that, in view of the fact that 
they regarded the process of magnification as 
being in the nature of the refracting substance 
\wiliout reference to the geometric form, they 
were on the right track to discover the scien- 
tific use of optical instruments. 

Assuredly, if such instruments had been 
known to the ancients, Pliny and others would 
have mentioned them. Certain authors treated 
specially of optical phenomena, for instance, 
Ari^totlo and his commentators on meteor- 
ology ; in the problems of Aristotle, and the 
Greek physician Alexander, relative to myopia 
and presbyopia ; in the dissertation of 
Plutarch on myopy ; in the chapters of Pliny 
on the sight, and on the diseases of ti:&lt;i eyes 
and their remedies ; and -ertainly in the ttxts 
of the Greek physicians on the same subject, 
from Hippocrates to Galen, and from Galen 
onwards ; and in those of the Roman physi- 
cians, from Celsus and Aurelian to Theodorus 
Priscian and Marcellus Empiricus. But no 
allusion is made to any of these instruments 
by these authors, nor by any other Greek or 
Latin author. On the contrary, we find in 
several writers of the early centuries of our 
era, texts which are irreconcilable with the 
hypothesis of the former existence of these 
instruments. In the 5th century of our era, 
the Greek physician Actius has nothing to say 
regarding myopy, further than that it is 
incurable ; and similarly, in the 13th century, 
the Greek physician Actuarius alludes to 
myopy as an incurable infirmity of sight, for 
which art can do nothing. But since the 
closing years of the 1 3th century, that is to 
say, since the invention of spectacles, they are 
referred to in the medical treatises, and in 
other works. 

It is unquestionable that the ancient artkts 
have left us works, such as gem- cutting, of 
extremely minute execution, and many modern 
writers, as Vettori, Dutens,* and I.ippcrt, have 
insisted that they could not have been pro- 
duced without the use of magnifying lenses.

French version (Dunod, Paris. 18S3). p. 3, of this excellent 
woik. which has had the advantage of annotations by the 
translators. 



Natter and Priestley think that they must at 
least have known the use of globes of glass, 
such as Seneca mentioned. But by reason ot 
the distortion which so rude a contrivance 
would produce, it is hardly possible that it 
could have been employed. Engraved gems 
have been mentioned, and ivory carvings, in 
which the workmanship was said to be too 
small to have been produced by the unaided 
sight. In the case of one statement of Dutens 
(2nd ed. II., p. 224) where reference is made 
to a seal in the Cabinet of Medals, in Paris, 
bu&lt;d to have belonged to Michael Angelo, and 
to date back to remote antiquity, on which 
fifteen figures were engraved in a circular 
space 14 mm. diameter&#8212; " figures .... not all 
visible to the naked eye," Mr. Philip Gardner, 
of the Medal Department, British Museum, 
has made on my behalf a special inquiry of 
M. Chabouillet, Director of the Cabinet of 
Coins and Gems, in Paris, who answered under 
date the 20th inst. (November, 1885), that it 
was an error on the part of Dutens " (1) The 
gem is not antique, it., Greek or Roman; 
(2) it never belonged to Michael Angelo." 

Then we have the statement of Pliny, that 
Cicero had seen a manuscript of the whole Iliad 
contained in a nutshell. But the ancients 
themselves may have exaggerated somewhat 
in speaking of their skill in the execution of 
such curious work. We need not deny that 
very minute work was executed by them. But 
in order to rebut the conclusions that have been 
deduced from the fact that minute work was 
produced, it may suffice to note that Pliny, 
Solirus, and Plutarch, allude to these marvels 
of workmanship for the purpose of proving by 
the examples of thj artists who executed them, 
that certain men arc naturally endowed with a 
quite exceptional power of vision. Pliny adds 
that the more minute portions of these sculptur- 
ing " cannot be discerned by ordinary men." 
Htrce it is clear that neither the authors nor 
the admirers of these minute chefs-tTceuvre 
knew the use of magnifying lenses. 

Mr. Murray, of the Gem Department, 
British Museum, informs me that in his 
opinion there is no engraved work in our 
national collection that can be affirmed to be 
antique, and that is beyond the power of the 
unaided vision of the specially qualified 
modern engraver. 

In reply to Lippert, who insisted that some 
of the antique work could not have been pro- 
duced without the use of magnifiers, Lessing 
says that, by the admission of trained gem- 
engravers, everything of this kind that can be

done with a magnifier may be done equally 
well, if not more easily, without. 

Galer. states that an aitist of his ac- 
quaintance had made a seal, on which was 
engraved the figure of Phaeton in a chariot 
drawn by four horses ; the mouths, the front 
teeth, the reins, and the sixteen feet of the four 
horses were all shown. "As for me,'' says 
Galen, " I could not at first perceive all these 
details, because of the extreme minuteness, 
except by turning the object towards a very 
strong light ; even then I could not distinguish 
everything, andmany persons were like myself; 
but when we could distinguish any part, we 
were agreed that it was executed with the 
greatest perfection." By these expressions of 
Galen, it is clear that neither this learned 
physician nor the artist, nor the other persons 
who examined the seal in his presence, knew 
the use of magnifying lenses ; and surely 
this must have obtained likewise among hir. 
contemporaries. 

Pliny, who gives us a multitude of details 
un the processes employed by the ancients in 
engraving precious stones, who has even told 
us of the methods adopted by the engravers 
to strengthen their sight, and who informs us 
that to repose their fatigued eyes they looked 
at emcrald.3 or green scaraba-i ; Pliny, the 
''ndustrious compiler of the practical know- 
ledge of antiquity up to his date, would not 
have failed on this occasion, or in speaking of 
the uses of glass, crystal, and transparent 
stones, of which he treated at considerable 
length, to refer to the use of dioptric lenses by 
engravers if they had employed them. The 
silence of Pliny, an.l of the learned Greek 
physician, Galen, demonstrates conclusively 
that in the first and second centuries of our 
era the use of magnifying lenses was unknown 
to the Greeks and Romans. 

Is it possible, indeed, that if the ancients 
had ever invented telescopes or microscopes, 
or spectacles for long or short sight, such in- 
ventions would have whuily disappeared from 
the hands and memory of men ? As a matter 
of fact, the employment of these instruments 
is found only where they have been introduced 
in modern times by Furopeans since their 
invention in Europe. 

The invention ef spectacles for long and 
short sight is referred to as a quite recent in- 
vention in a MS. datingfrom Florence in 1299.* 



&#8226; Cited in R. Smith's " Optici " (Cambridge, 1738, 2 vol*. 
4to.), ii., rp . it-j., and thus translated .&#8212; " I find myself &#187;o 
pressed by age, tbat I ran neither read or write without those 
glasses they rail spectacles, lately invented, to the great 
advantage of poor old men when their sight grows weak." 



Bernard Gordon, professor at Montpellier, in 
his Lilium medicincc, commenced in 1305, 
mentions spectacles as an aid to defective 
sight. Giordano da Rivalto, in 1305, says the 
invention dates back only "twenty years." 
They were, therefore, invented about 1285. It 
is known that they were invented by the 
Florentine Salvinod'Armato dcgli Armati, who 
died in 13 17. He kept the secret with a view 
to profit by it. But Alessandro della Spina, 
of Pisa, who died in 1313, having seen 
spectacles made by Armati, and having suc- 
ceeded in making them himself, hastened to 
publish the secret. 

As to the more powerful optical instruments, 
the telescope and microscope, although it 
would appear that Alhazen* in the 10th or 
nth century, Roger Bacon in the 13th, and 
Fracastoro and G. B. Porta in the 1 6th, had 
some idea that lenses might be made or com- 
bined so as to enable one to see distant objects 
better, or to magnify near ones beyond the 
power of normal vision ; yet it must be held, 
with Kepler, that no instrument analogous to 
our telescope was known before the beginning 
of the 17th century, and that the possibility of 
the invention is limited to a very few men of 
that period. And, further, it is certain that 
the invention of the microscope was not 
anterior to the last few years of the 16th 
century. 

Before proceeding with my subject in ap- 
proximately chronological order, I must not 
omit to refer to the so-called Assyrian " lens," 
which is in the British Museum, and which 
was brought somewhat into fame some yean, 
ago by the publication of Sir David Brewster's 
opinion that he regarded it as a "lens," and 
as furnishing a practical demonstration that 
magnifiers were known to the ancients. I 
must also note upon two "bosses " of glass, 
recently acquired by the British Museum,' 
which will doubtless be considered by some of 
the supporters of the antiquity of lenses as 
directly aiding to substantiate their views. 



The Assyrian " Zens."&#8212; A piece of rock- 
crystal, of "plano-convex" form was found 
by Mr. Layard at the excavations of Sargon's 
palace, Nimroud, which had evidently 
been shaped oval by a process of chip- 
ping and grinding, and of which both the 
"plane" and "convex" surfaces had been 
ground and part ly polished. This specimen

ij now in the Assyrian department of the 
British Museum, and in Sir David Brewster's 
opinion it is a " lens " designed for magnifying 
(rvaV Layard's "Nineveh and Babylon," pp. 
197-8); it is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. As it

was found together with certain objects of 
glass, one of which bears the name of "Sar- 
gon," I understand from Mr. Budge, of the 
Museum, that it lias been possible to fix the 
date with reasonable probability to be not 
more recent than 721-705 B.C. 

After repeated examinations of this piece of 
rock-crystal, I am unable to agree with 
Brewster's opinion. I do not suggest the 
possibility of proving that it is rot a lens ; but 
I think no proof whatever has been adduced 
that it was designed as a lens, i.e., to serve 
as a magnifier, while the probabilities seem 
against that supposition. 

(i.)I would point to the tact, apparently 
overlooked by Brewster in his description, that 
the broad bands of cloudy striae, extending 
diagonally and transversely through the sub- 
stance of the quartz would form a serious 
drawback to its use as a lens, whereas they 
would probably be considered as adding to the 
beauty as an object of decoration. These 
bands of stria? appear too opaque in Fig. 1, 
though their general character, as seen under 
certain effects of light, is faithfully rendered. 
(2.) The term " convex," as applied to a 
magnifying lens, is generally understood to 
mean a smooth spherical figure, such as 13 
produced by grinding in a spherically concave 
tool. But the "convex" surface in question 
was admittedly produced by grinding a multi- 
tude of irregular facets so as to approximate 



more or less to a shallow spherical or ovoid 
surface, much infer' jr to the surfaces the 
lapidary of the present day produces in tablets 
of obsidian, agate, &amp;c, for brooches, bracelets, 
&amp;c, of the commonest type. A surface of 
this kind is assuredly not " lenticular," as we 
apply that term to lenses. The Assyrian 
polishing was clearly of the roughest character, 
performed with apparent violence, and without 
regard to the existence of 'he deep scratches 
due to the grinding. The curvature is so 
irregular, and the polishing of both surfaces 
so imperfect, that objects appear indistinct 
even when placed in contact with the plane 
surface, while, if held some three or four 
inches away, the indistinctness and distortion 
render vision through the "lens" almost 
painful. (3.) Brewster says its "focus" is 
about 4$ in. from the plane surface. When 
held suitably to the sun, it is true there is a 
condensation of light which appears brightest 
at about 4J in. from the plane surface ; but 
this blurred mass of light can scarcely be 
termed a "focus" in the sense in which we 
apply that term to a lens. 

Ancient Glass Bosses.&#8212; More recently the 
British Museum has acquired two antique 
glass bosses, the external form of which 
is so regular that if any contemporaneous 
work could reasonably be regarded as 
impossible of production without the em- 
ployment of magnifying lenses, then these 
bosses might readily be supposed to be 
such lenses, either completed or in process of 
manufacture. But until collateral proof is 
found of the employment of magnifying lenses, 
any conjectures implying that these specimens 
were really designed as lenses must be mere 
guesses. The one specimen is of nearly hemi- 
spherical form, about 2jin. diameter. The 
surfaces meet nearly in a sharp edge, and 
spiral and irregular scratches on both sides 
would suggest some grinding process of manu- 
facture. The curved surface, when viewed by 
reflected light, appears so regular, that if it 
was not wholly produced by grinding in a con- 
cave tool, or by some equivalent process, it 
was probably cast in a very smooth and re- 
gular mould, and then ground and partially 
polished. Unfortunately, both surfaces are 
decomposed raid almost wholly covered by a 
semi-opaque opalescent shell ; and where 
fragments of Utfs shell have broken away, so 
that the body of the glass is exposed, the 
surface of the latter is covered with minute 
pits, and is generally disintegrated so that one 
cannot see through the substance. The

bt L.nid specimen seems to have been originally 
about the same size and shape as the former, 
but is now a broken segment somewhat less 
than half its original size. The surfaces are 
much less, injured by decomposition than in 
the former one, but still they are so dull that 
one cannot see an object distinctly through 
the substance. The surfaces of fracture show- 
that the glass is clear and transparent, and of 
slightly straw-colour. When viewed by re- 
flected light the curved surface does not appear 
*o regular in figure as the former one, and 
may possibly have been moulded by heat with- 
out further process. The date assigned to 
these "bosses " by the Museum authorities is 
not later than 270-260 B.C. 

And now, assuming that we cannot affirm 
with reasonable certainty that magnifying 
lenses were employed before the invention of 
spectacles, we shall not, I think, be far wrong 
in supposing that the gradual deepening of 
curves would lead to the production of lenses 
of shorter and still shorter focus, until a point 
was reached, when the combination of a 
convex lens as an object-lens with a concave as 
an eye-lens, accidentally distanced apart by 
the hands, would lead to the discovery of the 
telescope and microscope of the form gener- 
ally associated with the name of Galileo, but 
which, from the testimony of Galileo himself, 
was of Dutch origin,* and of date anterior to 
his own production of the telescope in 1609. 
This would appear to be the probable origin of 
the microscope consisting of a combination of 
a convex object-lens with a concave eye-lens. 

The Keplerian microscojie. consisting of a 
combination of a convex object-lens with a 
convex eye-lens &#8212; which is the simplest form of 
what is now termed a "compound" micro- 
scope&#8212; was probably later in date, subsequent 
even to the publication of Scheiner's " Rosa 
L'rsina," in 1630, in which the actual con- 
struction of a Keplerian telescope was claimed 
by Schciner, and notified as dating thirteen 
years previously, when he showed it in action 
to the Archduke Maximilian. 

The optical system was clearly laid dowr by 
Kepler, in his " Dioptrice," in 161 1. I remark, 
however, that De*:. .ti &#8226;*, in hi:. " Dioptrique," 
published with L'L*' Discours dc la methode " 
(Leyden, 1637,410), describes and figures both 
a microscope and a telescope with concave eye- 
lenses, and says not a word of the Keplerian

tion of the telescope is contained in Chap. as. of R. Grant's

forms of these instruments; theinference's.that 
he knew only the "Galilean" constructions* 
and the simple magnifying lens at that date. 
Moreover, the first publication of a Keplerian 
microscope actually constructed was by 
Fontana.t in 1646. Manzini, in his worW 
" L'occhialeall' occhio" (Bologna, 1660,410.), 
PP- ' 74"5' refers to one of these microscopes 
made by Eustachio Divini, in 1648, which he 
states could be reversed, noting this reversal 
as a peculiarity of the construction, but not 
recommending it in practice ; and he speaks 
of it as made on the Keplerian optical system 
as devised by Fontana. It would thus appear 
that we must not assign the origin of the 
Keplerian microscope, as an actual construc- 
tion, to an earlier date than 1646. It is true 
Fontana claims to have devised the instrument 
in 1618, but that date is wholly repudiated by 
Montucla and by Poggendorff. 

Modern Microscopes to the Date ok 
the Application of achromatism. 
It is, perhaps, impossible to assign the exact 
date of the first production of the microscope 
(as distinguished from the simple magnifying 
lens) ; but those who have given special atten- 
tion to the early testimony on the subject &#8212; 
notably, Van Swinden, Moll, Harting, and 
Poggendorff&#8212; are agreed that it must have 
been between 1590 and 1609; and that either 
of three spectacle-makers of Middelburg, 
Holland, named Hans Jan&amp;sen, his son 
Zacharias Janssen, and Hans Lippershey, 
may have been the i.iventor, the probabilities 
being slightly in favour of the Janssens. 
Poggendorff considers the. official documents 
found by Van Swinden in the national Archives 
of Holland, extracts from which were published 
by Moll ia 1831, prove conclusively that 
Lippershey invented the binocular telescope 
(with concave eye lens&#8212; the -Galilean" form) 
in 1608, the lenses of which were constructed 
of rock-crystal in consequence of the extreme 
difficulty in obtaining clear glass in Holland. 
By the testimony of Pierre Borel.J and from 

* Referring to telescope* of ttis form, which ho states 
were invented about thirty years previously (i.e., about 1607) 
byjaques Melius, of Altraar, Holland, Descartes says .&#8212;

personal information supplied to him by 
Willhem Boreel, Dutch Ambassador in Italy, 
who was a native of Middclburg, and had 
Known the Janssens, father and son : he had 
often heard from the elder Janssen 'h&#171;.&#163; he 
and his son were the inventors of the micro- 
scope, and that he had sent one to Prince 
Maurice of Orange, and another, later on, to 
the Archduke Albert of Austria. Boreel 
further stated that when he was Ambassador 
to England, in 1610, he saw the latter instru- 
ment in the hands of his friend Cornelius 
Drebbel, and described it as having a tube,' 
eighteen inches in length and two inches 
diameter, of gilt brass (copper), supported by 
three dolphins on a base of ebony ; and that 
objects placed on this base were seen consider- 
ably magnified through the tube. In 1610 
(according to Boreel' s recollection), the 
Janssens succeeded in producing a telescope 
for celestial observations. 

It is upon this evidence generally, supple- 
mented by that of Hans Janssen, the son of 
Zacharias, given in 1665 (1655 ?) regarding his 
father's statements ancnt his early connection 
with the invention of telescopes and micro- 
scopes, that the possibility of the invention of 
the latter is pushed back even as far as 1590. 
And it would appear that the first microscope 
on record was designed principally to view 
objects by reflected light, not by transmitted 
light. 

" Janssen' s" Compound Microscope&#8212; 
Some years ago (1866) an old microscope was 
found at Middelburg, which Professor Hartmg 
thought might possibly have been made by 
the Janssens. It was exhibited at the Loan 
Collection, in London, 1876, and is shown in 
Fig. 3. I have here a copy of the original. 
It is of thz Keplerian form, i.e., consists of a 
combination of a convex object- lens and a 
convex eye-lens, which form was not published 
{as an actual construction) till 1646, by 
Fontana ; hence, I think Harting was mistaken 
in assigning the construction to either of the 
Janssens. Nevertheless, because Harting 
thinks it may date back so early, I give it the 
first place in my budget of illustrations of 
modern microscopes. 

This instrument is strictly a compound 
microscope in the modern sense, though with- 
out a field-lens, and this latter fact enables me 
to admit that it may, at any rate, have been 
constructed before the application of the field-

lens to the microscope by Hooke, in 1665 {vide 
Preface to Hooke's "Micrographia "). The 
distance between the lenses can be regulated 
by two draw- tubes (one of which carries the 
object-lens in an inner adjustable tube) of thin 
iron-plate, fitting at either end of a middle- 
tube serving as a socket, so that within 
certain limits the magnifying power may be 
varied. There are three diaphragms in the 
instrument, one is placed at a variable distance 
in front of the object-lens, a second is at a 
fixed distance behind that lens, and the third 
is at a fixed distance above the eye-lens. This 
disposition of diaphragms is of great interest, 
especially if Harting is right in assigning 
the construction to the beginning of the 17th 
century. The eyc-lcns, b, is held in a simple

the object-lens, a, fits against a narrow metal 
flange at d, where it is held by a sprung ring. 
In the original instrument the latter ring is 
absent, so that the lens is loose, as shown in 
the Fig. (at least that appears to me the pro- 
bable explanation of the fact that the lens is 
not fixed in its cell).

Descartes* Simple Miceoscopf with 
Reflector (1637). 

Descartes claimed that it was much superior 
to the (then) common form of Flea Microscope. 
You will observe that the arrangement is prac- 
tically identical with the simple lens mounted 
in a central aperture in a polished concave 
metal reflector, generally known as " Licber- 
kuhn's" lens, constructed by Lieberkuhn, about 
1738. Lieberkuhn's device followed the pub- 



lication of Descartes' figure about a century. 
Descartes suggested the application of a short 
spike (seen at u in the Fig.) to hold the object 
at the focus of the plano-convex (hyperbolic) 
lens, which was to be directed fully to sunlight. 
In the same publication (p. 132) Descartes 
also figured a microscope of colossal size, 
consisting of a combination of a bi-convex 
object-lens and a plano-concave eye-lens (both 
supposed to be worked to hyperbolic curves), 
and with an enormous perforated parabolic 
concave mirror encircling the object-lens to 
illuminate opaque objects, and a condensing 
lens in the axis of the instrument for illum- 
inating transparent objects. This microscope 
is shown in Fig. 6 (p. 995 ). We have here 
the first combination, I have met with figured, 
of leuses funning a microscope. No means 
are provided for focussing except (apparently) 
the movement of the draw-tube containing the 
eye-lens. The dimensions and general form 
seem to me so very impracticable, especially 
for that early date, that I question if the device 
ever proceeded beyond the publication of 
the figure, while Descartes' instructions, that 
both instruments should be used with full sun- 
light, would also imply that he had never really 
used them in this way. I can hardly suggest 
what kind of object would not be vaporised in 
a few seconds if exposed at the focus of the 
gigantic parabolic mirror of the second form 
of Descartes' microscopes. 

Descartes' microscopes were briefly referred 
to by Kirrher (" De lum.et ucib..'' lib. 10), 
and by Gaspar Schott (" Magia Universalis," 
i 6 57-9&#187; I&#171;i P- 535). but have generally been 
passed over by later writers, including Harting ; 
the larger one has probably been frequently 
mistaken for a telescope. In the above-cited 
work, Descartes was, I believe, the first to pub- 
lish figures and descriptions of machines for 
grinding and polishing lenses, thus preceding 
Maiuini by tweuty-three years, and Hooke by 
twenty-eight years. 

"Divini' s ' ' andot her Microscopes. &#8212;In Uie 
above-cited work of Gaspar Schott five forms of 
microscopes are given (Pi. xxv., p. 525), which 
are here shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9 (p. 005), io and 
11 (p. 996). Fig. 8 may have been of the 
Keplerian form ; but this is not certain. Schott 
states (p. 535) that Fig. 10 represents a micro- 
scope constructed by Eustachio Divini ; but I 
have much difficulty in supposing that it can 
possibly have been intended for any serious 
purpose. Divini was a distinguished optician 
of his time, one of the very few in Europe then

would hardly neglect so important an innova-

claimed as a novelty. Campani provided a 
double focussing arrangement, one for regu-

ing the distance of the eye-lens from the 
object lens. The application of the second 
plate, held by springs to the base, for clipping 
the object-slide while permitting a fair 
range of movement, is good, and may have 
suggested the spiral - spring arrangement 
devised later by Bonanni. The central hole

ELEMENTARY LECTURES. 

ELECTRICITY. 

By Processor George Forbes. 

Lecture II.&#8212; Delivered April 10, 1886. 

"Currents a&#187;d Resistance." 
In the course of my last lecture I showed 
you the generation of an electrified condition 
of space, and the electric forces which were 
thereby produced, and I explained to you what 
we meant by saying that two things have a 
difference of electric potential. 1 also ex- 
plained to you the condition which exists when 
two bodies have a different potential, that is to 
say, that there is then created electromotive 
force, and if this electromotive force be free to 
act through a conductor so that induction takes 
place, there is a momentary current, and re- 
arrangement of the electrification. If, how- 
ever, the electromotive force is acting on an 
insulator no current can pass, and there is 
simply a strain crealed in the insulating 
medium which is ready to produce the phe- 
nomena of induction as soon as a facility is 
offered by the presence of a conductor of elec- 
tricity. Wc arc accustomed to measure our 
difference of potential in terms of some unit, 
and the unit which has generally been adopted 
is called a volt. When I say there is a differ- 
ence of potential between the two knobs of the 
machine I am using, amounting to 50,000 units, 
I mean 50,000 volts, snd that is about the 
difference of potential *hich we are in the habit 
of employing when we are using the electric 
machines. Wnen I rub a piece of sealing-wax 
on flannel I getadifference of potential amount- 
ing to an enormous figure like that, and yet I 
can get no serious injury from it, because the 
quantity of electricity is so small. We shall be 
coming on to-day to learn the means which we 
have for generating electricity in much larger 
quantities than we can even by means of the 



Wimshurst machine; but when we come to 
experiment with batteries, or the other me.ins 
for generating electricity in quantity, we shall 
be using very much smaller differences of 
potential than what we were using in the last 
lecture. A single cell of a battery mav have 
one or two volts difference of potential, but 
that difference of potential which exists in a 
battery is exactly of the same nature as that 
which exists in the Wimshurst electric machine 
which you saw last time. The electric current 
*&#187;mch passes to the earth during a lightning 
flash is identically of the same character as 
that electric current which passes through each 
telegraphic instrument from our batteries, or 
which is lighting up this room at present by 
n^.ana of these glow lamps. It is hardly 
necessary, at the present time, to insist on 
this&#8212; that there is only one kind of electric 
current. In former days it required the re- 
searches of the ablest experimenters to prove 
to the world that the electric current which 
might be generated by means of apparatus 
like our Wimshurst machine, was the same in 
character as the electric current which can be 
generated by means of plates of metal in- 
acidulated water. But we know with certainty 
that the effects are the same. I shall simply 
show you one experiment with the Wimshurst 
machine, to prove to you that one of the facts 
which we frequently find in dealing with bat- 
teries, can also be produced by means of such 
an influence machine. I have here a small strip 
of tinfoil which I shall place between two 
pieces of glass, and I shall then subject the 
two ends of the tinfoil to an electromotive- 
force due to the difference of potential 
between the two knobs of the machine. 
Then when I discharge this machine by 
means of the assistance of the Leyden jars 
which are attached to it, we shall be able 
to pass an electric current through this piece 
of tinfoil, and show the heating effect which 
is thereby produced. This will be an apt 
illustration of the analogous effects which can 
be produced by means of this influence 
machine, and the totally different means of 
generatingelectricity which we have in batteries 
and dynamo - machines. On turning the 
handle now the spark has passed between the 
poles, and I will hand round as a specimen- 
one of the pieces of tinfoil which was put 
their originally, and show you the fused con- 
dition of the tinfoil after the spark passed 
through it. Here is another specimen in which 
the effectiseven more powerfully shown, because 
not only has the tinfoil been actually fused.

Modern Microscopes to the Date of 
the Application of Achromatism 

(CONTINUED). 

Hooke's Microscopes.&#8212; We now arrive at a 
specially interesting date in th&#187; early history 
of the microscope-the publication of Hooke's 
compound instrument, in 1665, in his " Micro- 
graphia." whence my Fig. 13 ( p . loo8) is 
reproduced. 

Hooke's first claim h for the application of 
a powerful illuminating apparatus, consisting 
of a lamp adjustable on a standard, with a 
globe of water and a deep plano-convex con- 
densing lens on moveable arms, by which the 
light could be directed as required on the 
object. He thus describes his method of 
using sunlight: &#8212; 

" I place a small piece of oyly Paper very near the 
Object, between that and the light ; then with a good 
large Burning* ilass I so collect and throw the Rives 
on the Paper, that there may be a very great quantity 
of light pan through it to the Object; yet I so 
proportion that light, that it may not singe or burn 
the Paper. Instead of which Paper there may be 
made use of a snail piece of Looking-glass plate 
one of whose sides is made rough by being rubb'd 
on a flat Tool with very fine sand, this will, if the 
heat be leisurely cast on it, indare a much greater 
degree of heat, and consequently very much augment 
a convenient light." (P re f., pp . ,6-7). 

These suggestions all point to Hooke's 
practical ability in the actual use of the micro- 
scope. He notes ve,y clearly the advantage 
of employing this diffused light rather than 
direct sunlight, for" when the immediate light 
of the Sun falls on" an object, "the reflexions 
from some few parts are so vivid, that they 
drown the appearance of all the other, and are 
themselves also, by reason of the inequality of 
light, indistinct, and appear only radiant 
spots. (,d. , p. 1 7). On comparing these prac- 
tical remarks of Hooke's with Descartes- 
advice on the same point, namely, to condense 
direct sunlight on the objects, I am confirmed 
in my opinion that Descartes had probablv not 
used lus microscopes as he recommended'

Hooke describes his microscope in detail, 
commencing with his application of four draw- 
tubes for lengthening the body, which was 
normally "not above six or seven inches long. " 
Then he explains his addition of a third lens 
to the optical combination, whence we infer 
that previously the compound microscopes 
contained two lenses only &#8212; an object-lens and 



an eye-lens. This third lens was applied in a 
cell on the top of the cylindrical tube, so as 
to be readily removed ; he used it, as he states, 
" only when I had occasion to see much of an 
Object at once ; the middle Glass [field-lens] 
conveying a very great company of radiating 
Pencils, which would go another way, and 
throwing them upon the deep Eye Glass. But

when ever I had occasion to examine the small 
parts of a Body more accurately, I took out 
the middle Glass, and only made use of one 
Eye Glass with the Object Glass " (*&#187;., p. 22). 
How far Hooke's application of a field-lens 
to the eye-lens of a microscope may have been 
suggested by the invention of the compound 



eye-piece associated with the name of Huy- 
ghens* (though attributed by some authorities 

* In the notice of Huyghcns in tbe " Biographic Univer- 
&#8226;pile," it it itatrtl that he applied " une combination de deux 
oculaires " to hit telescope previous to 1659, /&gt;., some years 
before the publication of Hooke's application of a field-lens 
to the microscope.

to Campani), I cannot determine. In any case, 
the sole purpose Hooke had in view, according 
to his own statement, was to increase the size 
of the field of view, and had nothing to do with 
correcting the spherical aberration of the eye- 
lens. His plain admission that he removed 
the field-lens when he was seeking the best 
definition is conclusive on this point. 

From the description of the mechanism of 
this microscope, given by Hooke, I think he 
intended to claim the general design. The 
ball-and-socket movement of the body to the 
arm-carrier is thus described : &#8212; 

" On the end of this Arm [D, which slides on the 
pillar C C] was a small Ball fitted into a kind of 
socket F, made in the side of the Brass Ring G, 
through which the small end of the Tube was 
screw'd ; hy means of which contrivance I could 
place and fix the Tube in what posture I desir'd 
(which for many Observations was exceeding neces- 
sary) and adjusten it roost exactly to any Object " 
(&#187;'&#171;., p. 23). 

The ball-and-socket movement, as here 
applied, is certainly not advantageously 
situated. In the microscopes I have met with 
constructed on Hooke's general design, this 
movement was replaced by a strong short screw 
attached to the ring, G, and fitting in a corres- 
ponding screw-socket projecting from, and 
forming part of, the sliding arm, D ; this screw 
arrangement permitted the lateral inclination 
of the body-tube, and a thumb-screw at the 
side of the screw-socket clamped it in position. 
In several figures of Hooke's microscope, 
published since 1665, this modification is 
shown; for instance, in Sturm's "Collegium 
Curiosum " {1676), Fig. LXX., and in Zahns 
" Oculus artificialis " (1685), which we shall 
examine. 

It would appear that Hooke's introduction 
of the ball-and-socket in the construction of 
the microscope has met with numerous advo- 
cates since; it may not be uninteresting to 
cite a few examples by way of illustration. 

J. Musschenbroek (1707) applied three of 
tlicsc movements, as articulations, to his 
simple microscope. Marshall (1704) used a 
large one with a tightening collar at the lower 
end of the standard to his compound form. 
Joblot (1718) had three on his simple lens- 
carrier; and Lyonet applied five to his, 
Cnlpeper (about 1730) mounted Wilson's 
simple, and his own application of the com- 
pound to the same, on a ball-and-socket, with 
adjustment on the top of the standard. B. 
Martin (1742) used it similarly with his first 



form of " Universal Microscope." Adams, 
Jones, Dollond, Pyefinch, Bates, and other 
English makers of the latter part of the last, 
and early part of this century, used a sort of 
chain composed of ball-and-socket joints to 
carry forceps, &amp;c. A greatly improved form, 
with a powerful clamp, was devised by Goring 
to support his " Engiscope " on the top of the 
standard {vide Fig. and description in Prit- 
chard's " Microscopic Illustrations," London, 
1830, royal 8vo). More recently we have had 
stage-movements (by Varley, Powell and Lea- 
land, Smith and Beck, Dancer, and others) 
controlled by ball-and-socket attached to a 
lever; in one instance&#8212; Varley' s small model 
&#8212;two such levers acting together were applied. 
Micoscope-lamps, mirrors, condensers, side- 
reflectors, illuminating prisms, forceps, and 
camera: lucidae, have all been fitted with ball- 
and-socket movements. The high-water mark 
of the application is probably reached in 
Marten's " Ball-jointed Microscope,'" in 
which two of these movements are applied to 
carry the body-tube, and the stage is a hemi- 
sphere moving in a hemispherical cup, specially 
devised for the examination of large specimens 
of metals, &amp;c, that cannot be readily viewed 
by an ordinary microscope. 

The facility of movement provided by the 
ball-and-socket joint would seem to have 
attracted the notice of designers of micro- 
scopical appliances in every generation since 
its introduction by Hooke. For small acces- 
sories, where the leverage need not be con- 
sidered, the ball-and-socket is convenient, 
though its use demands, in general, more 
manipulative skill than is required with the 
usual pivot mechanism ; but it should not be 
applied *&#187; the main support of the inclining 
movement of the body of a large microscope. 
Even when made with a powerful clamp, as 
Goring devised, there is always the risk that 
when the clamp is released, the instrument 
may capsize through negligence in handling. 

Hooke also explains minutely the con- 
struction of the object-stage thus : 

"Fur placing the Object, I made this contnTance: 
upon the end of a small brass Link or Staple HH, 
I so fastaed a round Hate II, that it might be turn'.l 
round upon its Center K, and going pretty stiff, 
would stand fixt in any posture it was set ; on the 
side of this was fixt a , ma \l yniu P, about three 
quarters of an inch high, and through the top of tin-, 
was thrust a small Iron pin M, whose top [pointed

end] just stood over the Center of the Plate ; on this 
top I fixt a small Object, and by means of these 
contrivances I was able to turn it into all kind of 
positions, both to my Eye and the Light ; for by 
moving round the small Plate on its center, I could 
move it one way, and by turning the Pin M, I could 
move it another way, and this without stirring the 
Glass at all, or at least but very little : the Plate 
likewise I could move to and fro to any part of the 
Pedestal (which in many cases was very convenient) 
and fix it also in any Position, by means of a Nut 
N, which was scrcw'd on upon the lower part of the 
Pillar CC" (/ft.). 



This object-stage seems to me based on 
sound practical ideas&#8212; ideas *hat have only 
been duly appreciated in out own time, as 
shown by the now genera! application of the 
rotating stage, which our ancestors almost 
totally ignored. The link clamped down upon 
the base was an admirably steady support for 
the rotating plate, far superior to the generality 
of stage devices contrived before the system 
developed by Ooerhacuser was employed (about 
1830). 

Hooke appears to have been dissatisfied with 
the lenses he used. He says :&#8212; " The Glasses 
I used were of our English make, but though 
very good of the kind, yet far short of what 
might be expected, could we once find a way 
of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more 
true shape." He complains that the " Aper- 
tures of the Object-glasses are so very small, 
that very few Rays are admitted, and even of 
those few there are so many false, that the Object 

appears dark and indistinct " Of the 

" best Glasses," he states that "none will 
admit a sufficient number of Rayes to magnifie 
the Object beyond a determinate bigness" 
(id., p. 16). To remedy the inconvenience 
due to the want of light transmitted by the 
microscope he devised the lamp and condensers 
described above to illuminate the object more 
powerfully. 

It is evident that Hooke discovered thus 
early the importance of increasing apertures ; 
but the greater apertures he had in view were 
merely to provide a greater quantity of light 
from the object to enable him to get higher 
magnification&#8212; the magnification he aimed at 
being limited by the want of light. He says 
nothing, nor could he be expected to say any- 
thing, regarding any increase of resolving 
power by the increase of aperture, for the con- 
nection between aperture and resolving power 
could hardly have been seriously considered 
from any practical point of view, in the 
construction of either dioptric telescopes 



or microscopes, before the application of 
achromatism. 

We may infer that other large microscopes 
were in use at that date, for Hooke states that a 
blown-glass globule.* prepared and used as he 
describes, will "make some Objects more dis- 
tinct then any of the great Microspores" 
(id., p. 22). It would appear also that the 
viewing transparent objects by transmitted 
light was not yet discovered to be thi prin- 
cipal utility of high powers, for Hooke, in 
explaining that " the larger the Telescope 
Object Glasses are, and the shorter those of 
the Microscope, the better they magrifie," 
qualifies the statement (as relating to the 
microscope) by adding that it will ba exceed- 
ing difficult ... to inlighten an Object 
less then an hundred part of an inch distant 
from the ObjectGlass" (/A., pp. 19-20). Clearly, 
then, Hooke thought only of viewing opaque 
objects with high powers. The difficulty he 
notes with reference to the illumination would 
not apply to transparent objects. A proximity 
of one hundredth of an inch would be no 
serious obstacle to viewing objects by trans- 
mitted light, and would certainly not impose 
a limit (such as he implies) to the magni- 
fication. 

Hooke also describes a compound micro- 
scope he devised to have two refractions only, 
consisting of a conical tube, at the small end 
of which he cemented a plano-convex lens of 
short radius, with its convex surface outwards, 
for the object lens, and at the larger end he 
cemented similarly a larger lens of greater 
radius ; then, by means of a small hole in the 
side, he filled the tube with water, stopping 
the hole with a plug. With this arrangement, 
he states, " I could perceive an Object more 
bright then I could when the intermediate 
space was filled with Air, but this, for other 
inconveniences, I made but little use of" 
(**-. P- 23). 

He also made other forms of microscopes, 
some of "Waters, Gums, Resins, Salts, 
Arsenick, Oyls, and with divers other mixtures 
of watery and oyiy liquors" (/&#187;.); he adds, 
" I find generally none more useful then that 
which is made of two Glasses, such as I have 
described " (id.), thus leaving his invention of 
the " Middle Glass," or field-lens, to take 
care of itself. 

Hooke was, I believe, the first to describe a 
u seful method of estimating the ma gnifying

power of a compound microscope. He 
says : &#8212; 

"Having rectifi'd the Microscope, to tee the 
deurd Object through it very distinctly, at the same 
time that I look upon the Object through the Glass 
with one eye, I look upon other Objects at the same 
distance with my other bare eye; by which means I 
am able, by the help of a Rultr divided into inches 
and small parts, and laid on the Pedestal of the 
Microscope, to cast, as it were, the magnified appear- 
ance of the Object upon the Ruler, and thereby 
exactly to measure the Diameter it appears of through 
the Glass, which being compar'd with th- Diameter 
it appears of to the naked eye, will easily afford the 
quantity of its magnifying " (&amp;, p. 22). 

This method is, obviously, applicable only 
to objects that can be plainly discerned by the 
unaided eve. 

Hooke was one of the earliest to note upon 
the difficulty of distinguishing between a "pro- 
minency and a depression " with the micro- 
scope (pseudoscopy), which he states that he 
observed when preparing the drawings for the 
illustrations of his " Micrographia," which 
would be in 1664, if not earlier. Prof. Govi,* 
in his work on the " Discoverer of a Singular 
Optical Illusion." refers to a printed letter of 
Eustachio Divini to Count Carlo Antonio 
Marozini, dated 15 July, 1663, in which certain 
phenomena of pseudoscopy are described; 
Divini may, therefore, have preceded Hooke in 
these observations. I remark, in passing, that 
Divini refers in this letter to "Microscopes 
with two glasses," and states that when he 
wanted to see the whole of rather large objects 
he removed the deep object-lens and substituted 
a lens of shallower curvature ; but, apparently, 
he knew nothing at that date of the use of a 
field-lens in the ocular; this would appear to 
confirm indirectly Hooke's claim to be the 
first to apply a field-lens to the ocular of a 
microscope. 

The series of drawings of common objects, 
such as a needle point, a razor edge, snow 
crystals, spiders, and other insects, &amp;c, as 
seen under his compound microscope, were 
doubtless viewed with much asloniithmpnf hy 
many of Hooke's contemporaries, and his 
" Micrographia " soon became a scarce and 
expensive book. In the descriptions of these 
objects he touches incidentally upon an 
enormous mass of details regarding micro- 
scopical manipulations, etc., details evincing 
great industry and acuteness of observation.

lished in 1678, under " Microscopium," pp 
96-7, we find Hooke no longer advocating the 
double ' ' microscope in his former enthusiastic 
tone. Whether this change of opinion was 
due to the publication of Leeuwenhoek's 
successful observations with simple micro- 
scopes I cannot determine. Hooke has been 
suspected by many who have sought to inform 
themselves of the history of his contributions 
to science, of being somewhat over-anxious to 
keep himself to the fore ; but this must not 
prevent our acknowledgement of his real 
merits. He states that in using plano-convex 
lenses as single microscopes, " 'tis best to 
turn the plain side towards the object, and 
the convex to the eye;" and that he him- 
self had not used any less than i-ioth inch in 
radius of curvature, because they strained his 
sight, " though in truth they do make the 
object appear much more clear a.id distinct, 
and magnifie as much as the double Micro- 
scopes : nay, to those whose eyes can well 
endure it, 'tis possible with a single Micro- 
scope to make discoveries much better than 
with a double one, because the colours which 
do much disturb the clear vision in double 
Microscopes is clearly avoided and prevented 
in the single." 

Hooke must undoubtedly be credited with 
the first suggestion of immersion lenses, 
thus : &#8212; 



" If further, you would have a Microscope with 
one single refraction, and consequently capable of 
the greatest clearness and brightness that any one 
kind of Microscopes can possibly be imagined 
susceptible of, when you have fixt one of these little 
Globules as I have directed [globules of blown-glass, 
the preparation of which be had described], and 
spread a little of the liquor upon a piece of Looking- 
glass plate, then apply the said plate with the 
liquor, next to the Globule, and gendy move it close 
to the Globule, till the liquor touch ; which done, 
you will find the liquor presently to adhere to the 
Globule, and still to adhere to it though you move it 
back again a little; by which means, this liquor 
being of a specifique refraction, not much differ- 
ing from glass, the second refraction is ouite 
taken off, and little or none left but that of the 
convex side of the Globule next the eye ; by which 
means as much of the inconvenience of refraction as 
is possible is removed, and that by the easiest and 
most practicable expedient that can be desired " 
(*&#187;., pp. 08-9). 

The criticism I have made on Campani's 
screw-focussing adjustment applies still more 
to Hooke's microscope, for here the body-tube, 
being much longer and heavier, would be certain

Nothing is said about the application of a 
mirror, nor have I met with any microscope, 
provided with a mirror, of date anterior to about 
fifty years later than Hooke's instrument, i.e., 
1710-1720. 

Hookc appears to have entrusted the manu- 
facture of his microscopes for sale to " Mr. 
Christopher Cock, in Long-Acre" {ib., p. 99). 
I have dealt somewhat fully with Hooke's 
microscopes, but not more fully than I think 
they deserve in view of the fact that he was 
the first to give a real impetus to Knglish 
microscopy in the two main branches in which 
it is divided&#8212; the optical and mechanical con- 
struction of the instrument, and its application 
to research &#8212; in both of which his influence 
was conspicuous. It would be an easy task 
to prove, by citations from the contemporary 
scientific publications, that Hooke's work as a 
microscopist gained him European fame. For 
my own part, I can never forget that one of 
the most eminent men of science of our day, 
one whose competence to form a fair and 
accurate judgment is beyond question &#8212; 1 
allude to Herschel &#8212; has referred to Hooke as 
" the great contemporary, and almost the 
worthy rival of, Newton " (" Discourse on 
Nat. Philos.," p. 116). 

Divini"; Microscope. &#8212; Soon after the pub- 
lication of Hooke's compound microscope, we 
find in the " Giornale de Letterati," I. (1668), 
pp. S2--1, a description (partly translated in 
"Philos. Trans," HI., 1668, p. 84*)of acom- 
pound microscope constructed by Eustachio 
Divini, which had already been commended by 
by Fabri; in Prop. 46 of his " Synopsis Optica" 
(1667). It was stated to be about 16J inches 
high, and adjustable to four different lengths 
by draw-tubes, giving a range of magnification 
irom 41 to j 43 diameters, instead ot trie 
usual bi-convex eye-lens, two plano-convex 
lenses were applied with their convex surfaces 
in contact, by which he claimed to obtain a 
much flatter field. In the Museo Copernicana, 
at Rome, there is a microscope answering to 
this description &#187;o closely that I think we may 
safely refer its origin to Divini. I made a 
sketch of it, from which my Fig. 14 has been 
copied. The tripod base terminating above in 



a cylindrical socket is of tin ; the body-tubes 
are of cardboard covered with grey paper, and 
the magnifications of the various lengths are 
noted on each tube. The lowest tube slides 
within the metal socket of the tripod, and 
carries the object-lens in a thin cell of tin slid 
on the end; the next tube slides over the 
former, and has an external collar at the lower 
end, apparently to serve as a stop to the next 
tube ; the third and fourth tubes are similar, 
but progressively larger, and a diaphragm is

glasses, of which four eye-glasses were 
plano-convex, two and two so put together, 
as to touch one another in a point of the con- 
vex surface." The eye-piece was thus a modi- 
fication of that of Divini; whence it would 
appear that our opticians were alert in seeking 
improvements. We shall see later on that 
Grindl (1087) adopted this eye-piece, and 
applied a similar construction to the objective. 

Chdrubin tf Or Wans' Microscopes.&#8212; She 
next microscope in order of date we shall ex- 
amine was designed by Cherubin d'Orleans, 
and published in his treatise, " La dioptrique 
oculaire," in 1671 (Paris, fol., Plates 30-1, pp. 
2j8 and 261), vide my Fig. 15. Cherubin 
evidently haH &#171;, high opinion of his microscope, 
giving minute instructions for its construction 
with detailed figures. The three " consoles," 
or scroll supports, were to be of ebony or 
olickened pear-tree, firmly attached to the 
base and lo the collar encircling the fixed 
centra! portion of the body-tube. An exterior 
sliding tube carried the ocular above on the 
fixed tube, and a similar sliding tube carried 
the object-lens below, the sliding tubes serving 
to focus the image and regulate within certain 
limits the magnification. He further suggested 
and figured a screw arrangement to be applied 
beneath the stage for focussing, the optical 
body in this case to consist of two tubes only, 
and the object-lens remaining stationary. 

Cherubin also described and figured a stage- 
disc on which several objects were to be 
mounted concentrically, and this disc was to 
be attached to route on the focussing stage, so 
that objects could be viewed successively in the 
optic axis by the mere rotation of the disc. 
He was thus probably the inventor of the 
multiple object-disc, modifications of which 
have had some vogue in our own time, both in 
Europe and America, and even in Japan, as 
we shall see later on. He also figured spring 
forceps, and a "stab" on articulated joints, 
to hold insects, &amp;c. 

With regard to the optical arrangement of 
this microscope, Cherubin recommends so 
many different combinations of lenses that I 
cannot determine with certainty which he 
rcallypreferred. His recommendations embody 
so many items as to remind one forcibly of 
certain modem specifications of patents, in 
which it is sought to include every possible 
(not to say impossible) combination within the 
sphere of the invention. At p. 217, in leferring 
to a microscope composed of two convex 



lenses, he states that the object-lens may be 
f. i&#187; or &#163; inch focus at most, and equi-convex. 
" Its eye-glass, not requiring to be far from 
the objective, must be of a rather larger sphere, 
for instance, about J, 1, or 1 J inch focus at 
most. ' ' Another construction, which he states 
(pp. 220-1) he actually made, contained a 
second lens in the ocular, having a focus in 
relation to the eye-lens as 2} : i, or 3 : i ; and 

Fig. 15.

his remarks on the effects observed by placing 
the field-lens too near ta, or loo far from, the 
eye-iens seem based on actual experience. 
He notes upon the combinations of three and 
four separate lenses, by which objects may be 
seen in their natural position (erect), and 
states that the latter is "much to be pre- 
ferred" (p. 264).

made on Chirubin's system, constructed early 
in the iSth centurv according to the instruc- 
tions given in " La vision parfaite," in which 
the mechanism was excellent. Fig. 17 showing 
the optical construction, is copied from the 
original diagram (" La vision parfaite," 
Tab. I., Fig. 2, p. 80). Hooke criticised the 
instrument with some asperity (" Lectures, 
Microscopium," pp. 101-2), probably be- 
cause Cherubin stand it had enabled him to 



discover mistakes in certain recently published 
figures of microscopical objects (alluding to 
some of the drawings in Hooke's " Micro- 
graphia"). Hooke was obliged, however, to 
admit " failures in some of those draughts, 
some of my own and some of the gravers com- 
mitting. Humanum est. But those which 
he [Chen .bin] charges for such ate not, as he 
might have seen if he had made use of better 
glasses than those which he describes, for they 
are so far short of equalling those I use, that 1

can demonstrate from his own Description of 
them, that those I made use of did magnifie

the microscope far better " with one eye only 
[/.&lt;?., the monocular microscope"! , which is 
mnrfa to be preferred hdbre that wiih two 
[binocular]." And he asks the very pertinent 
question (which I think has not been satis- 
factorily answered even by the advocates of 
the binoculars of our own day), "what Dis- 
coveries he [Cherubin] doth make with his 
binocular Microscope more than was seen 
before." 

Newton's Reflecting Microscope.&#8212; \n 1672, 
Newton communicated to the Royal Society 
(" Phil. Trans/ VI.. 1671-72, p. jo8o), a short 
note and diagram descriptive of his Reflecting 
Microscope&#8212; the first suggestion of a micro- 
scope acting by reflection-as follows :&#8212; 

" I have sometimes thought to make a Murosco/v, 
which in like manner should have, instead of an 
Object-glass, a Reflecting piece of metall. And 
this I hope they [the Royal Soc.] wOl also take into 
conrideration. For those instruments seem as 
capable of improvement as TtUtcofxs. and perhaps 
more, because but one reflective piece of metal] is 
requisite in them, as you may perceive by the annexed 
diagram [reproduced in Fig. if} where AB teprc-

senteth the object metal], CD the eye-glass, F their 
common Focus, and O the other focus of the metal], 
in which the object is placed." 

It does not appear that Newton ever had this 
microscope constructed. The modern instru- 
ments termed reflecting graphoscopes are 
equivalent to Newton's reflecting microscope 
in construction, except that they are not fur- 
nished with an eye-lens. 

Leeuwenhoek' s Microscopes. &#8212; In 1673, 
Leeuwenhoek commenced communicating his 
discoveries with the microscope to the Royal 
Society. Beyond the occasional statement that 
his observations were made with simple micro- 




scopes (as distinguished from the Keplerian 
compound instrument, for the " Galilean '' 
combination seems to have almost drifted out 
of -nemory from its very early construction in 
the ,-th renn.ry down to its re-advocacy by 
Brucke in this century). T.&#187;&#187;cuT.cnhoik ex- 
plained iiothing by which his contemporaries 
couid furnish themselves with instruments like 
those he employed . and this silence added to 
the mysterious awe with which he and his work 
were regarded. He was extremely shy of ex- 
hibiting his microscopes to any one ; and some 
of his contemporaries taxed him with a greater 
love of praise than of truth because of his 
eagerness in claiming discoveries. Even as late 
as 1709 the real construction of Leeuwcnhoek's 
microscopes was not certainly known (vide 
"Phil. Trans.," XXVII., pp. 24-27. "A letter 
from Dr. Archibald Adams to Dr Hans Sloane, 
R.S.Secr., concerning the manner of making 
microscopes, &amp;c," where Dr. Adams, after 
describing that " they appear'd to be spherules 
lodg'd between two plates of gold or brass, in 
a hole whose diameter might not be bigger 
than that of a small pin's head," adds, " but 
still their make and truth are unknown "). 

Now that we know exactly the kind of instru- 
ments Leeuwenhoek employed, there can be 
no difficulty in the admission that his reputation 
as a discoverer in microscopy was really based 
on his patience and dexterity in the preparation 
of his objects, and on the skill he brought to 
bear on the interpretation of his observations. 
As to his microscopes, their construction was 
of the rudest kind mechanically, whilst optically 
they consisted of simple bi-convcx lenses with 
worked surfaces mounted between two thin 
metal plates with minute apertures through 
which the objects were viewed directly. At his 
death he bequeathed to the Royal Society a 
cabinet containing twenty-six of his micro- 
scopes, which were reported upon by Martin 
Folkes, Vice-President of the Society, in the 
" Phil. Trans.," XXII. (1723), pp. 446-63. 

T- '7;o these microscopes were examined, 
and reported upon to the Royal Society, by 
Henry Baker, F.R.S. ("Phil. Trans.," XLI., 
"740. PP- 5&lt;&gt;3-&#171;9). and it appears that they 
ranged in power from 1-20 to 1-5, magnifying 
from 1 60 to 40 diameters. In 1 753 Baker gave 
two outline drawings representing both sides 
of one of these microscopes in his " Employ- 
ment for the Microscope" (PI. XVII., Figs. 
7 and 8. pp. 434-6), whence my Figs 19 and 20 
(p. 101&amp;) are copied. The cabinet and the 
microscopes have disappeared from the Royal 
Society. Baker's description is as follows :&#8212;

Lkel -wenhokkS MiCKOSCOPE. 



By the courtesy of Prof. Hubrecht, of Utrecht 
University, I am enabled to give figures of one 
of the Leeuwenhoek microscopes belonging to 
the Museum of that Univereity ; it is shown in 
Figs. 2i and 22 full size. The lens is bi-con- 
vex, of about 1 -4U1 inch focus, and is mounted 
between two concavities provided with minute 
apertures, made in two corresponding thin 
plates of brass, which are held together by 
three rivets, two at the upper end, and one at 
the lower. The object is held in front of the 
lens, on the point of a short rod, the other end 
of which screws into a small block or stage of 



brass, which is rivetted somewhat loosely pfl 
the smoothed cylindrical end cf p long coarse- 
threaded screw acting through a socket angle- 
piece attached behind the lower end of the 
plates by a small thumb-screw. The long 
screw serves to adjust the object under the 
lens in the vertical direction, whilst the pivot- 
ing of the angle-piece on its thumb-screw 
gives lateral motion. The object-carrier can 
be turned on its axis, as required, by screwing 
the rod into the stage. For focussing, a thumb- 
screw passes through the stage near one end, 
and presses vertically against the plates, 
causing the stage to tilt up at that end ; the 
fitting of the long screw-carrier (angle-piece) 
is such that the stage at the end is sprung 
down somewhat forcibly on the brass plates.

and it is against this pressure that the focus-

object-carrier has a small projection, which 
appears to have been intended by Leeuwenhoek 
to fit in the hole beneath, in the brass plates, 
and thus retain the object opposite the lens.

a compound microscope. Sturm also gives a 
figure of Hooke's microscope as modified 
probably by one of the constructors who made- 
it for sale; we shall presently come to a figure 
givon by Zahn, almost identical with it. 

Microscopes from Zchn's " Oculus 
artificialis."&#8212; The two editions of Zahn's 
"Oculus artificialis" (1st ed., Herbip , 1685, 
fol. ; 2nded., Norimb., 1702, fol.) contain a 
considerable number of figures of curious micro- 
scopes, from which we may select a few. 

(1 .) Early English Microscopes.&#8212; -In the first 
edition (1685), under the heading "Microscopii 
Anglicanl" (Fundamcntum III., p. 26), we find 
th j six microscopes shown in Fig. 25 (p. 1018). 
Of these. Figs. 1 and 4* are early types of the 
fixedtripod support for the body-tube, which was 
developed by Culpeper and Scarlet some fifty 
years later into popular models that were taken 
up by the Xurnberg toy-makers of that date, 
and whose successors have continued to manu- 
facture them iu large numbers down to our own 
time. The original models generally had body- 
tubes of leather or parchment stamped and 
gilt, with supporting rings of wood. The 
tripods were of brass attached to wood bases. 
The lenses were mounted in wood or horn cells, 
sometimes with screw-rings to fix them, hut 
generally with rings of bent wire sprung in ; 
and caps were supplied 10 cover the eye-lens. 
These instruments mostly have large fieid- 
lenses ; and in the early models the focussing 
by screwing the body-tube in a socket at the 
top of the tripod is nearly always met with ; 
the sliding body-tube for focussing was rarely 
made until fifty years later. In Fig. 4 the 
rotating multiple object-disc appears. Fig, 2 
shows two supports for the cross-bar in which 
the body-tube screws ; but this model does not 
appear to have had much vogue. Fig. 3 seems 
to have been a modification of Hooke's model 
&#8212; a modification for the worse. Fig. 5 shows 
another form of rotating multiple object-disc 
forming the stage itself. Fig. 6 is another 
modification of Hooke's model ; the stage is 
no longer carried on a link encircling the 
standard. This last instrument is practically 
identical with the one figured in Sturm's 
"Collegium Curiosum " to which I have already 
referred.

Simple Microscope with Rotating Multiple 
Object-disc (1685). 



In the early days of the microscope, attention 
seems to have been given principally to 
opaque objects ; this instrument, however, 
was designed to view transparent objects only 
The disc, K L, was fitted to rotate on the pin, E, 
in the centre of the cap, A B, and this cap was 
applied within c l&gt;, so that the aperture would 
be opposite the lens-carrier, G H. The handle, 
X, served to rotate the disc, so that the objects 
passed successively in the field of view. Micro- 
scopes, more or less modified from this con- 
struction, were devised early in the 18th 
century by Joblot, who used high - power 
simple lenses, and hence had to provide deli- 
cate means of focussing. The system is still 
occasionally applied to "popular" micro- 
scopes.

which is reproduced in Fie 27. I have 
termed it an "Augsburg" microscope, 
because the design is very like several 
dther models which are known to have 
been constructed at Augsburg towards the 
close of the 17th century. From the number 
of instruments of this inferior class figured by 
Xnhn, I think we may infer that the micro- 
scope was rapidly becoming vulgarised. The 
system of focussing by rotating the body by 
means of the socket travelling on the screw- 
standard must have been very defective in 
practice.

ELECTRICITY. 
By Professor George Forbes. 

Lecture III.&#8212; Delivered April 17, 1886. 

In my first two lectures I spoke about statical 
electricity, and about a current of electricity, 
and I mentioned that there was a time when it 
was absolutely necessary to prove that these 
two manifestations of electrical influence were 
&#8226;dcr.tics'.. N" w , &#187;h^r&lt;&#187; is no doubt about it. 
We know that statical electricity and dynamic 
electricity are identical, that there are not two 
kinds of electricity, but that the phenomena 
we studied on the occasion of the first lecture, 
and the phenomena we considered on the 
occasion of the second lecture, are really 
different manifestations of one identical force. 
The discharge of the Wimshurst machine is 
identical with the current from a battery, and 
the difference of electric potential at the ter- 
minals of a battery ; s of the same character 
as that at the two knobs of the Wimshurst

THE MICROSCOPE. 

By John Mayaix, Jun. 

Lecture III.&#8212; Delivered December 7, 1885. 

Early Italian Microscopes.&#8212; In an Italian 
work, entitled &#8226;&#8226; Nvove inventioni di tvbi 
ottici." which appears to have been a com- 
munication to the "Accademia Fisico-mate- 
matica," of Rome, in the year 1686, signed by 
"Carlo di Napoli" (but which was probably 
written by Ciampini, the editor of the 
" Giomale de Letterati," vide Langenmantel's 
notes on Tortoni's microscope in " Miscell. 
curiosa," 2nd Decade, 7th year, 1689, p. 444), 
a Plate is given of a number of curious forms 
of microscopes which are reproduced in Fig. 12 
(p. 1032). 

The microscope, shown in Fig. 1, is 
similar to the one we noted from Sturm's 
"Collegium curiosum." Fig. 2 is a sort of 
goblet with a lens on the top. Fig. 3 is not 
glazed at the sides, so that the objects could 
be readily changed. Fig. 4 seems to me an 
older form than Cuno's simple microscope, 
which we have examined, and may be the 
original design that suggested Cuno's which 
was improved upon by Musschenbroek, 
Wilson, Lieberkuhn, and others, down 
almost to our own time ; it has generally 
been termed "The Opaque Microscope." 
The rod, b, carrying the lens-holder, A, slides 
and turns in the sockets, D D, and the forceps, 
OH, fit similarly in EE; dd and E E are 
pivoted at F. The forceps are sprung open by I 
pressure of the screw 1. Fig. 5 embodies 



quite original points (so far as I know) ; the 
objects are fixed on the edge of the vertical 
disc, G, which rotates under the lens in the 
centre of the disc, D, and different portions of 
the objects can be brought in the optic axis 
by the screw-action of the peg, H ; c is a 
spring carrying the lens-holder, D, and by 
means of the cord, E, winding on the peg, r, 
the lens-holder was drawn down to the proper 
focus, or by the reverse action it was raised by 
the spring, c. Fig. 6 is of special interest from 
the fact that it is stated to have been designed by 
"Hombergh, Gentiluomo Indiano" &#8212; Homberg 
the well-known member of the "Academic des 
Sciences," of Paris, and whose "FJoge" was 
written by Fontenelle. The eye-piece was of 
peculiai design, the field-lens being mounted 
at the upper end of an inner tube over which 
slid an outer tube having the eye-lens at the 
top; the separation of the lenses could thus 
be varied. The body was of brass, on which 
a screw-thread was cut on a length of about 
two inches, and the focussing was effected hy 
rotating the body in the brass screw-socket, 
A n ; the extended bearing of the screw 
(which had a rather fine thread) made the 
movement far more accurate and steady than 
was usual in microscopes of that date. Fig. 
7 shows the same model, said to be improved 
by mounting the body to screw in a ring on an 
arm on a pillar, instead of the tripod. Fig. X 
was designed by "Carlo Antonio Tortoni." 
For viewing transparent objects, this microscope 
was to be directed to the sky, the light passing 
through the aperture, E, in the base-plate. 
This microscope was furnished with a field-lens, 
otherwise its similarity to the Campani instru- 
ment, we have examined, is manifest. Another 
somcMh.it similar microscope, by Tortoni. was 
communicated to the "Miscell. curiosa" (cited 
above) by Langenmantel. Figs. 9 and 10 are 
attributed to "Marco Antonio Cellio;" the 
lower tube, in Fig. 16, screws in the socket at 
A for focussing ; the upper is a draw-tube ; a 
field-lens is applied ; the object-slide passes 
through a slot in the base, and is held bv 
springs (shown at E e in the circular figure on 
the right). Here, again, the modifications 
from Campani's design (except, of course, the 
presence of the field-lens) are but slight, as, 
indeed, noted by the author of the paper. 
Fig. 11 is said to be the "smallest of all the 
microscopes;" the sides were of wood, and 
the multiple object-disc (No. 2) was fitted to 
rotate between them, the portions, N m, pro- 
jecting at the edges for convenience of turning. 
The lenses are said to have been made of

in 1668 (cited under my notes on Hooke's 
microscopes), who used two pairs of these 
lenses in his microscope. Grind) combined 
with the latter eye-piece a pair of similar (but 
smaller) lenses acting together as an objective, 
as shown in the diagram. 

The form of the stand appears to have been 
copied from that of Cherubin d'Orleans, modi- 
fied, however, by the application of an external 
screw to the body-tube acting in a screw- 
socket for focussing. 

Bonanni's Microscopes. &#8212; In Bonanni's 
" Micrographia curiosa " (Rome, 1691, 4to), 
p. 26, we find the microscopes shown in Figs. 
34 and 35. The interesting point in the design 

Fio. u-

MlCKOSCOFE OF BoMASM. 

of Fig. 34 is that the focussing can be effected 
by a "zcrew barrel" arrangement acting on 
the object, which is clipped between two plates 
and pressed away from the object-lens by a 
spiral- spring. This system of focussing was 
shown more practically (as we shall see) by 
Hartsoeker (1694), in combination with a con- 
densing leas ; and Hart sot- ker's design was 
clearly the original of Wilson's (1702). 

In Fig. 35 the focussing is effected by rotat- 
ing the body-tube in a screw-socket. The 
plate, O, was fixed ; the object was s.id between 
1 and o, and a spiral-spring within E l&gt; pressed 
it in contact with G. The tube, u, was put as a 
sheath over E 1, D I, to exclude all light but 
that transmitted by the object when the instru- 
ment was directed to the sky. The design of 



this microscope is similar to, but an improve- 
ment on, that of Cellio {vide Fig. 3a, Fig. 10), 
which was but slightly modified from Cam- 
pani's, as we noted.

Microscope of Bonanni. 

Bonanni is better known as the author of the 
horizontal compound microscope in Fig. 36 
(P- ,0 35). which is copied from the original in 
the same work, p. 28. The convenience of using 
the microscope in a horizontal position, with a 
lamp and condenser in the same axis, is 
obvious, especially in view of the fact that 
nearly all the compound microscopes designed 
previously had to be used vertical, or directed 
to the sky. The mechanism appears to modern 
eyes somewhat primitive ; but we must not be 
too exacting in our criticisms on this point, 
We have to acknowledge our obligations to 
Bonanni for initiating the system of the 
horizontal microscope, and for a graphical 
presentation of a compound condenser fitted 
with focussing mechanism for illuminating 
transparent objects by transmitted light. 

ffartsoeker's Simple Microscope. &#8212; In 
Hartsoeker' s " Essay de Dioptrique " (Paris, 
1694. 410), p. 175. we find the microscope shown 
in Fig- 37 (P- 1036). I must at once call your 
attention to the fact that in every essential point 
of design, Hartsoeker's microscope anticipated 
Wilson's "screw-barrel" microscope (pub- 
lished in the " Phil. Trans.," 170a), which 
became so popular in the 1 8th century. The 
lens-carrier, A B (on which the cell, p, contain- 
ing the lens, is screwed), screws into the body

C, Q n, at o Q ; the thin brass plates, E 
and F, fit within the body, the portions cut out 
allowing them to slide on the short pillars, O c 
and Q D, and the spiral-spring pressing them 
towards tn; the object-slides, or an animal- 
cule cage, G H (hinged at a b to allow the lid, 
O, to fit into H, enclosing the objects between 
strips of talc), slide between the plates, E and 
K, when in position, and the " screw- barrel," 

1 K, fits into the screw-socket, C i&gt;, and 
regulates the focussing ; a condensing lens, N, 
fits on a second " screw-barrel," I. M, which is 
applied in the screw-socket of I K. Thisarrangc- 
ment of the condenser is better than the plan 
adopted by Wilson, as it allows the illumina- 
tion to be focussed on the object independently 
of the focal adjustment of the object t' the mag- 



nifying lens ; whereas, in Wilson's microscope, 
the condenser being mounted in I K, without 
facility of adjustment, remained at a fixo! 
distance from the object, and hence the control 
of the illumination was very limited. 

Hartsoeker appears to have been an expert 
in microscopical observations at a very early 
age. According to his " Eloge" by Fontenelle, 
when still a student of geometry, he constructed 
microscopes of blown-g'ass globules, and used 
them in the observation or discovery of minute 
forms of life with so much success, as to excite 
the jealously of Leeuwenhoek. His skill in the 
construction and use of the microscope brought 
him to the notice of Huyghens, by whose 
recommendation he was made a member of the 
"Academic des Sciences," of Paris.

'* Mem. de l'Acad. Royale des Sci.," it if. 
stated that in 1678 he reported having brought 
microscopes from Holland, consisting of 
" minute spheres of glass," some of which 
were not larger than a grain of sand. 

Gray's " Water Microscope."&#8212; -In the 
" Phil. Trans.," XIX. (1696), pp. 353-6, Gray 
communicated the design of his water micro- 
scope, shown in Fig. 38 (p. 1037), together with 
notes on its use. He had previously figured 
and described (/&#163;., pp. 281-3) a simpler form, 
consisting of a plate of brass with minute 
holes in which drops of water were to be 
placed, but without arrangements for holding 



the objects to be examined. Here, however, 
we have an object-bolder, C l&gt; E, pivoted at 
1 k on the lens-carrier, A B, the point, f, serving 
\ for such objects as could be fixed upon it. 
while the hole, c, was intended for drops of 
the fluid to be examined ; G is a thumb-screw 
acting through the plate, A B, by which the 
object-carrier wasfocussed under t lie water 1- , .

"washer;" the carrier was made of well- 
hammered brass, and sprung somewhat up 
from E so as to follow the movement of g. 
At a was a concavity about 1-8 inch in diameter, 
with a hole through the plate 1-33 inch in 
diameter&#8212; the plate itself being 1-8 inch thick 
&#8212; and on the other side was a corresponding

concavity of 1-16 inch diameter, the two meet- 
ing in an edge in the plate. Drops of water 
were put in these concavities, forming a bi- 
convex lens of unequal curvatures, by which, 
with care, interesting observations could 
doubtless be made. At it a cylindrical hole 
1-10 inch was made, and in this either a 
shallow lens was formed by not inserting too 
much water, or a fluid containing organisms 
was inserted gradually until both surfaces were 
deeply convex, then, applying the eye suitably, 
one was expected to see the organisms by 
means of pencils that had undergone total 
reflexion within the water before being refracted

to the eye &#8212; which process of observation was, 
I should say, both ingenious and useless. 

In the early part of this century Brewster 
attempted to revive the use of fluid lenses, in 
some experiments following those of Gray, with 
modifications. Gray had made lenses by 
allowing drops of a warm solution of isinglass 
to solidify on plates of glass, either on the 
upper surface or suspended beneath. Krewster 
improved on this plan by using drops of Canada 
balsam, v.'hich would dry hard and be more 
transparent and less liable to injury. He also 
proposed (in conjunction with I&gt;r. Blair) a 



number of combinations of fluids and lenses to 
obtain achromatism, and, in fact, he ap- 
pears to have sought to exhaust the subject of 
fluid lenses. Many of Brewster's favourable 
criticisms' on the fluid lenses he devised have 
failed of any practical issue ; and, except by 
here and there an enthusiast&#8212; especially those 
who are unaware of Gray's and Brewster's 
priority &#8212; lenses consisting of drops of water, or 
other fluids, applied with more or less inge- 
nuity to form practical microscopes &#8212; are 
generally regarded as things of the past, not 
worth reviving. The possibility of seeing objects 
greatly magnified by means of a drop of water 
used as a lens should be known to botanists 
and others who may happen, in an emergency, 
not to be provided with better means. 

Wilson's Microscopes. &#8212; In the " Phil. 
Trans.," XXII. (1702), pp. 1241-7, we find a 
description, with four Figs, of the two " small 
Pocket Microscopes" shown in Fig. 39 
(p. 1038). Fig. 1 is the simple microscope that 
was termed, later on, the " screw-barrel ;" its 
resemblance to Hartsoeker's instrument is 
obvious. The object-lens (of which there were 
seven of different foci, Fig. 2 representing the 
lowest power, mounted in " a little Barrel Box 
of Ivory") was mounted in the disc, B, screw- 
ing in the tube, A A, below ; the object-slide, as 
ee, or an aquatic tube, g g, was applied in the 
the centre between the plates at E B, the spiral- 
spring, 11 , pressing it upwards ; D was a 
hollow cylinder with an exterior screw-thread 
travelling in a screw-socket at the upper A A, 
thus controlling the focussing, c was a cell, 
containing a condensing lens, forming a con- 
venient grip for actuating the screw movement 
of D. In action, the lens in B was applied to 
the eye, and the instrument directed to the sky 
or other source of light. 

This form of microscope, with slight modi- 
fications, became very popular in the 18th 
century. It was originally made of ivory ; but 
the great majority were of brass ; occasionally 
it was made of silver. Its great success was 
probably due to its simplicity, whence it could 
be produced in large numbers at very moderate 
cost. The size rendered it easily portable, 
and the design was so plain and substantial, 
that it could be used by the veriest novice 
without risk of injury. The form lent itself 
readily to the application of a handle ; then it 
was easily mounted 00 a pillar, and u&#171;.ed

with or without a mirror ; a very simple addi- 
tion rendered it convenient for viewing opaque 
objects ; the compound body could be added 
without difficulty, which was done by Culpeper, 
as we shall see, and diaphragms were applied 
to the condenser ; with slight modifications it 
was combined with various forms of heliostat, 
thus becoming an essential feature in the solar 
microscope ; and, combined with a system of 
large condensers, it became the lantern micro- 
scope, as used far into this century. 

Fig. 3 shows the " opaque microscope " de- 
vised by Wilson. The series of magnifiers 
made for the above instrument were also used 
with this; they were each provided with a 
small hole, at the side of the ivory cylinder in 
which the lens was mounted, by which they 
could be fixed on the spike, A (as shown in 
Fig. 4). The object was held by "a small 
pair of Tongs, o G," or placed upon the black 
or white side of the ivory disc, H, at the other 
end. The focussing was effected by the milled 
nut, D, acting on the screw, c, which was fixed 
in the arm, i&gt;, the spring, B, giving the reverse 
motion when the nut was turned the opposite 
way. The pivoted arms gave ample range of 
motion to adjust the object under the lens. 

This instrument was a decided improvement 
on Cuno's Simple Microscope (Fig. 31), and on 
the Italian form shown in Fig. $&#187;, Fig. 4. 

Before passing on to the examination of 
other models, we will note upon some of the 
modifications of Wilsca'i " screw- barrel " 
microscope that were devised in the 18th 
century. 

(1.) Culpeper's Simple Microscope (Wil- 
son's form).&#8212; Fig. 40 shows Culpeper's appli- 
cation of a folJing tripod base with pillar to 
Wilson's model, \/Hh the addition of the lens- 
carrier on an arm to enable the instrument to 
be used with opaque object'. I have not been 
able to fix the date of this instrument ; but as 
none of the examples I have seen were furnished 
with " Lieberkuhns," we may infer the con- 
struction was probably anterior to 1738. A 
ball-and-socket joint supports the microscope, 
and with so small an instrument it was not so 
defective as with larger ones on the pillar. 
A complex system of articulations clamped on 
the pillar carries a condensing lens for illumi- 
nating opaque objects, or a plane mirror, as in 
*'*?&#8226; 4' (P- 1040). For viewing opaque objects 
the iens was removed from the body-tube, and 
a disc, having a pivoted arm terminating in a 
ring, substituted ; the low-power lens, in a horn 
mount was then screwed in the ring, and was 
thus held some distance away from the body 



of the instrument, so that the object could be 
properly illuminatsd. This arrangement is 
shown in the Figure.

In Fig. 41 we have the same instrument as the 
preceding, but with a compound body-tube of 
ivory, with draw-tube substituted for the lens- 
carrier. A plane mirror takes the place of the 
condensers on the articulated arm ; in later 
constructions, Culpeper applied the mirror on 
one of the feet in a line with the optic axis. A 
set of three diaphragms (of which one is shown 
in front) can be placed over the condenser in 
the lower end of the " Wilson " screw-barrel. 
The ivory handle is shown, on which the 
"Wilson" is held when unscrewed from the 
ball-and-socket ; the box end is unscrewed 
where discs of talc, and brass wire rings, for 
holding the talcs in cells, were stored. An 
early form of animalcule cage is shown 
in front, having four concave discs of glass 
mounted in apertures in a plate on which a 
similar plate, with four corresponding aper- 
tures and plane discs, is hinged to open or 
close. 

The instruments of Culpeper's manufacture 
were sometimes covered with ornamental en- 
graving. In this example, the lens-carrier for 
opaque examinations, the forceps-plate, the

Afarshair r Compound Microscope. &#8212; In 
Harris's "Lexicon technicura " (1704, 2 vols. 
fol.V under the word microscope, Marshall's 
compound microscope (Fig. 44, p. 1042) is de- 
scribed and figuied. Several important innova- 
tions in microscopical construction were here 
embodied. ( 1 .) A fine-adjustment screw, F, is 
connected with the sliding socket, E, support- 
ing the arm, b, in wnich the body-tube is 
screwed; the focussing could thus be con- 
trolled in a far more effective manner than by 
any system previously applied to a large 
microscope. The previous systems involved 
the direct movement o T the body-tube, either 
by rotating in a screw-socket (as in Hooke's), 
or by sliding in a cylindrical socket (as in 
Divini's and Cherubin's) ; ia a few instances 
the object was moved in relation to the object- 
lens ; but all these plans were more or less 
defective, especially with microscopes of large 
dimensions. Marshall's system was a distinct 
mechanical improvement, for the object could 
now be viewed during the actual process of 
focussing, as the image would remain steadily 
ir. the field. (2.) Hooke's arrangement of a 
link to encircle the pillar and carry &amp; 
routing stage, is here modified into a fork, 
N N, and, instead of being clamped on the 
base by a thumb-screw on the fixed pillar, 
it is here applied with a similar thumb-screw 




clamp, o. on the pillar itself. (3.) Hooke's 
ball-and-socket joint, which was applied to 
the arm, I, is here shifted to the lower end of 
the pillar, where it would give the movements 
of inclination to the whole microscope, instead 
of to the body-tube only, as in Hooke's ; the 
ball, L, could be tightly clamped by the screw- 
collar, m, in which slots were cut to give 
spring. In one example I have met with, the 
slots were not cut, whence I infer that it may 
have been one of the first of the kind con- 
structed, before the slots were applied. (4.) 
A condensing lens on jointed arms appears ; 
I think this was the first application of such 
adjustments to the condenser. From the 
singular position of the candle beneath the 
condenf or, I think we may infer, without doubt, 
that the mirror was still unknown as a micro- 
scopical accessory in England. 

As a matter of fact, I have met with this 
model of Marshall's microscope bearing the 
date, 1718, still without mirror. The earliest 
instrument I have seen provided with a mirror 
was a modification of Marshall's, in which the 
ball &#8226; and &#8226; socket was replaced by a rigid 
pillar, and the open-link stage-carrier was 
replaced by an arm, attached to a socket 
rotating on the pillar, and fitted with 
appliances decidedly in advance of those 
figured by Harris, or indeed of any belonging 
to actual models I have seen of Marshall's ; 
and the date of the construction I should 
assign mould be 171 8- 1730&#8212; probably earlier 
than the Culpeper instruments we have ex- 
amined, in which the articulations of tin 
mirror-support point to an experienced use of 
the mirror. 

Harris commends Marshall's arrangement 
of the fish-trough with the " Lead Coffin," u, 
" to be put on the Fish to hinder it from spring- 
ing away, and moving his Tail out of the 
Light " while under examination. The series 
of object-lenses were apparently regarded as 
novel in connection with a compound micro- 
scope. The numbers on the standard were to 
indicate approximately the position of the 
coarse adjustment for the different powers. 
To counterbalance the instrument when in use, 
as figured, the opposite end of the base had a 
large block of load fixed inside. 

The figure of Marshall's microscope has 
been reproduced very frequently in Encyrlo- 
pxdias, and other works ; and occasionally 
the position of the candle has been said to be 
more favourable for depositing soot on the 
condenser than for illuminating the object. 
The instrument should be judged by com-

as typical, at least, of the ornate designs pro- 
posed by Joblot. The lens was mounted in the 
small cylindrical tube in the centre of the 
vertical plate on the right, to the lower part of 
which a rod was attached passing into the 
lower horizontal tube, and with a screw at the 
other end acted upon by a nut for focussing. 




Joblot's principal claim to recognition as a 
designer in connection with the evolution of 
the microscope, is the fact that he devised a 
rotating object-stage (applied to the model here 
figured) that may have suggested to Oberhaeuser 
the plan he worked out so successfully ; but on 
this latter point I speak with reserve, for the 
similarity in the mechanism is not a proof that 
the one was based on the other. 

Joblot mounted a simple lens on an arro 
composed of three ball-and-socket joints 
attached to a short stem ; it is in con- 
nection with this construction that his name 
has been handed down to us in the succession 
of works treating of the microscope. He was, 
however, so distinctly preceded by Musschen- 
broek in the essentials of his design, that I 
pass over that form. For the same reason I 
pass over Lyonet's Simple Microscope, which 
differed from Musschenbroek's and Joblot's, 
in being attached to an oval stage of wood, 
supported at one end by a brass pillar con- 
necting it with the base, and with an aperture 
through which the light from a mirror was 
reflected on the object. 

Barker's " Catoptric Microscope." &#8212; In the 
" Phil. Trans." XXXIX. (1736), pp. 250-61 
(5 Figs.), Barker described this instrument (Fig. 
46, p. 1044) as " contrived ... on the Model of 
the Newtonian [Gregorian] Telescope ..." It 
was arranged to magnify " from the Distance 
of 9 Inches to 24 Inches," so that opaque 
objects could be easily illuminated and viewed. 
The focussing was effected as with the Gre- 
gorian telescope, i.e , by mean? of a rod and 
screw, 11 L, (Fig. 2) acting on the small con- 
cave speculum, c D. The eye-piece had a 
plano-convex field-lens, G H, and a bi-convez 
eye-lens. The instrument was mounted on a 
cradle-joint on the top of a pillar, and was not 
&#8226;&#8226;onnected with the object (Fig. 1). 

The construction was simply that of a 
Gregorian telescope of very short focus, with 
an extra range of movement for the small 
speculum to focus objects distant only from 
u to 24 inches. 

The diagram, Fige,, shows thepath of the rays 
from the object to the eye. By bringing the 
small concave nearer the large one, more and 
more distant objects would be viewed, until the 
instrument would become a telescope proper ; 
thus furnishing an example of the conversion 
of a microscope into a telescope, or, conversely, 
" Thus a telescope used for viewing very near 
objects becomes a microscope," as stated by 
Herschel ("Encyclop. Metrop.," art. "Light," 
p. 403).

much in vogue in the &#187;8th century, and was 
modified by Adams, Dollond, and others. In 
some instances the pillars were made very 
ornate, especially by Italian opticians. Adams 
added a fourth pillar, and applied a rack-and- 
pinion to the body- tube and socket forfocussing. 
In odd examples I have met with, the construc- 
tion of which suggested that they were prob- 
ably made by Brander, of Augsburg, the socket 
of the body-tube was hinged on the stage by 
two short pillars, so that the upper part could 
be inclined in relation to the stage. The 
Nurnbei 5 toy-manufacturers seem (as I have 
already noted) to have popularised this tripod 
form, probably because the design could be 
carried out easily in wood and cardboard at a 
small outlay ; occasionally they applied two or 
more draw-tubes, and added to the body-tube 
an arrangement similar to Bonanni's (Fig. 35) 
for holding the objects.

struction of a reflecting microscope of the 
Cassegrainian form, shown in Fig. 48, for view- 
ing transparent objects, is given in detail. 

This microscope was similar "o the Casse- 
grainian telescope, but with an extra long eye- 
piece tube to permit the focussing by move- 
ment of the eye-lens. The object was placed 
at U N ; the image was taken up by the 
concave, reflected on the convex, and again 
reflected to the eye-lens. He advised the 
use of a condensing lens for the illumination, 
to prevent " the mixture of foreign rays with 
those of the object," otherwise the instrument 
gave confused images of distant objects when 
it was used as a microscope.

Culpeper and ScarUfs Compound Micro- 
scope. &#8212; This microscope (Fig-. 47, p. 1045) was 
published in K. Smith's "Opticks" (Camb., 
1 738, 2 vols. , 410), I . , p. 407, and was considered 
by Smith as a better form than any that preceded 
it. From our point of view this commendation 
appears strange, for the general design does 
not suggest a convenient working instrument. 
There was no fine adjustment, and the 
focussing was effected by sliding the body- 
tube in the socket. A rotating multiple object- 
disc, v x, js seen (reversed in the Fig. to show 
the "button" in the centre by which it was 
fitted in a slit, /, and held by the small brass 
sliding plate, t, under the stage). The spring- 
stage, m n, fitted in the aperture, /&#8226;, and acted 
after the manner of modern safety stages. The 
fish-trough, q (shown reversed), was applied 
at i, and the "&#187;coffin," t (devised by Marshall), 



held the fish still. From Smith's reference to 
the " concave looking glass, yz," I think we 
may infer that the application of a minor WM 
new to him. 

Smith mentions that he had occasionally 
used this model as a Reflecting Microscope, 
after the method explained by Newlou (kc 
F'ig. 18). For this purpose he removed the 
mirror, y z, and substituted the slotted spring- 
lube, D, in which a concave speculum. 
cemented on the tup of A it, was adjustable by 
means of a small wooden cylinder, c, beneath; 
then he removed the field-lens from the eye- 
piece and the object-lens, f, from the body- 
tube, placed an object on a piece of clear 
glass at k, condensing light upon it by the 
lens, &#171; 0, applied at /, and by sliding the 
speculum up or down, and adjusting the eye- 
lens correspondingly, so that the object and

examined, the objects are magnified very

Lit beriii fin's Simple Microscope (as made 
by Adams).&#8212; About 1738, Lieberkuhn devised 
a combination of a simple lens, mounted in a 
central aperture in a polished metal reflector, 
which he applied to a small hand-microscope 
(similar to the second form of Wilson's, vide 
*"&#8226;&#163;&#8226; 39) lor the special purpose of viewing 
opaque objects. Fig. 49 shows the microscope 
as made by Adams (vide " Microgr. illustr.," 
loc. cit.). The combination of a lens and 
reflector (shown at K) is practically identical 
with that of Descartes (1637), but the applica- 
tion to a convenient hand-microscope rendered 
it infinitely more serviceable. As proposed 
by Descartes, the object had to be viewed as 
it happened to be attached to the spike, and 
required complete re-adjustment for every dif- 
ferent view ; but Lieberkuhn's application by 
which the lens was no longer fixed to the 
object-carrier, left the latter free to be turned 
and adjusted a* required by the forceps, A*c. 



Cuff, the English optician, is stated to have 
improved upon Lieberkuhn's original con- 
struction (where one reflector served for lenses 
of different foci) by making a series of reflector* 
to correspond with the foci of the lenses, a&gt; 
that the objects were more perfectly illuminated. 

Lindsay (174a) used not only spherical con- 
cave reflectors, but also hollow cones of 
polished silver. 

Dellebarre(i777)made extra large reflectors 
of silver, and also of silvered glass, for his com- 
pound microscope (vide Lalande's description 
in Montucla's "Hist, des Mathematiqses," 
anded., 1709-1802, III., p. 511). In several of 
Dellebarre's microscopes that I have examined, 
the large perforated silver mirror was idjust- 
able on the nose-piece of the body-tube, with 
a range of upwards of an inch of screw-motion. 

The " Lieberkuhn " was readily modified 
in construction so that it could be applied to 
achromatic objectives by means of a cylindrical 
tube sliding on the end of the moucting, and 
has thus held its own to this day.

Charles Chevalier (1830) made use of a 
perforated silvered mirror of glass to avoid the 
inconvenience of tarnishing, especially where 
chemical re-actions were under observation. 
Amici (1840) made some extremely small 
"Lieberkuhn's;" in one I have met with, 
of silver, the concavity was less than 1 -8th inch 
in diameter. 

Lieberkuhn's Solar Microscope (as im- 
proved by Adams). &#8212; Lieberkuhn was the 
inventor of the solar microscope (1738). As 
first devised, there was no mirror, the micro- 
scope with the condenser had thus to be 
directed to the sun, which was done by means 
of a " Scioptric Ball and Socket," and the 
screen upon which the magnified image was 
projected had to follow the movement of the 
microscope. The English optician Cuff is said 
to have improved upon Lieberkuhn's arrange- 
ment by the application of a mirror iheliostat) 
with rr, -chanism , by which the sun-light could 
be directed constantly through the microscope, 



and the magnified image projected on a fixed 
screen. In the earliest form of solar micro- 
scope I have seen by Cuff, the rotation of the 
mirror on the axis of the microscope was 
effected as shown in Fig. 50, p. 1047 (copied 
from Baker's "The Microscope made easy," 
3rd ed., 1744, p. 22), by means 01 a cord 
encircling a large grooved wooden disc, B, 
on which the mirror was hinged at one end, 
and earned over a second and much smaller 
disc or wheel, 4, connected with a thumb-screw, 
5 ; the other movement of the mirror being 
controlled by a rod, H, connected with the 
mirror-frame by a jointed arm, 6, and passing 
through a metal friction -socket in the rotating 
disc, H, terminating in a ring, 8, by which it was 
moved. The heliostat was also made in this 
way by Martin in his earliest examples. 
The arrangement was improved shortly after- 
wards by making the moving parts of brass ; 
the disc, B, was toothed on its circumference, 
and a pinion controlled the rotation; a worm-

wheel and endless-screw gave the other motion. 
I cannot say who devised these improvements ; 
the latter one was, however, shown by Adams 
in 1746 (" Microgr. illustr.," PI. IV.), together 
with his application of his " New Universal j 



Single Microscope " (Fig. 51). Martin 
claimed the former, if not both ; at any rate, 
in his "Micographia nova" (174a), his de- 
scription of the solar microscope refers only to 
a " Scioptric Ball and Socket " arrangement,

so he did not know of the application of a 
mirror at that date. 

The various references to the use of the solar 
or Camera obscura microscope, published in 
the last century, show that far too much was 



claimed for it. Martin, Adams, and Baker 
seemed to vie with each as to who could

ture microscope (Fig. 5a) is of two-fold interest 
to us: (1), it was the first microscope for which 
a patent was registered (1742); (2), the design 
is so neat and compact and so novel, and the 
workmanship so superior to the rivals of its 
day, that one has a difficulty in accepting the 
fact of its construction in 1742.

ELECTRICITY. 
By Professor George Forbes. 

Lecture IV.&#8212; Delivered May 8/A, 1886. 

In a previous lecture, when we were ex- 
amining the current, we saw the means by 
which we could create electric currents, and 
we saw something of the way in which these 
electric currents act. It will be my endeavour 
to-day to show you some experiments illustra- 
tive of the enormous progress which was made 
during the years 1820 to 1830, the results of 
which have 'ormed the foundation of the whole 
of the most important developments and prac- 
tical applications of electricity since that date. 
Previous to the year 1820, there were but few 
phenomena known connected with the electric 
current. We knew that the electric current 
would heat up conductors ; we knew that we 
could get a spark from the charcoal points 
from Humphry Davy's celebrated experi- 
ment, &#171;hich led eventually to the construction 
of the arc light ; we also knew that cherr&gt;ica! 
substances could be decomposed by means of 
the electric current, but beyond that practi- 
cally nothing wis known. A certain number 
of facts, isolated and non-reproducable, appa- 
rently had been collected. It bad been found 
that there was some sort of connection between 
magnetism and electricity, but as to the 
nature of this connection nothing was known. 
It had, however, been observed that frequently 
00 board ship, during a thunderstorm, when a 
flash of lightning struck the vessel, the com- 
pass needle was either rendered useless, or it 
might be caused to point in the exactly oppo- 
site direction, its north end pointing south, 
and its south end pointing north. It appeared 
then that this electric current and the dis- 
charge of lightning had some connection with 
magnetism, but up tr&gt; the year 1820, there 
was no clue as to what the connec- 
tion between those two was. In my last 
lecture i showed you what very intimate 
connection there would now seem to be 
between electricity and magnetism 5 and every 
step of our progress to-day will shoT you the 
connection still closer. In the year 1883 there 
was a grand exhibition of electric appliances 
in Vienna, and 1 remember well, after wan- 
dering round that enormous building in the 
Prater, where was collected 1 display &#8212; the 
developments of electric science in every &lt;&#171;&lt;&#8226;

partment&#8212; in telegraphy, telephony, electric 
lighting, electric clocks, and all kinds of 
electric appliances ; after having examined all 
these dynamo machines, arc lamps, and other 
things, I came, in a secluded corner, upon a 
minute exhibit, which made me pause with a 
feeling of respect, and almost of awe, when 1 
looked at this small apparatus, and thought of 
the consequences which had followed from the 
experiments made with it. This was simply a 
compass needle placed on a stand with a glass 
shade over it, and above the compass needle 
was 3. bust of the man who had used this 
simple apparatus. I assure you that when 1 
thought of the experiment that had been made 
with that compass needle, and when I saw 
that, from that single experiment, the whole of 
the principles involved in the vast assemblage 
of electric apparatus in that building almost 
immediately followed, one could not help 
feeling that there was something to have 
respect for. I need hardly say, the exhibit I 
was looking at was the compass needle, and 
that the bust behind it was the bust of Pro- 
fessor Oersted, of Copenhagen. His grand 
experiment was the genesis of all that has 
been done in electro- magnetism since then, 
and I think that you and I shall be able 
to see this afternoon, as we take up one 
experiment after the other, how it might 
have been possible almost to have fore- 
told from that one experiment a vast number 
of phenomena which were discovered after- 
wards, and which form the fundamental 
principles of our science. The experiment of 
Oersted was H bringing a wire through which 
an electric current was passing into the 
neighbourhood of a suspended compass needle. 
Here I have a compass needle suspended on 
a pivot. In my ha.id I hold a wire, through 
which 1 am able to pass an electric current 
by connecting its two ends with a battery. 
The direction of the current is shown by the 
afro?.- on this wire. The lesurt is, that if the 
wire containing the current be held parallel to 
the needle, it will be deflected : n one direction 
or the other, and the direction in which the 
magnet is deflected depends partly on the 
direction of the current, and partly on the 
position of the current above or below the 
needle. First, i place the current travelling 
from north to south, and 1 place the current 
over the compos* needle. Yea will then see 
that the north pole, which is the one to my 
right, moves towards me, that is to the east. 
I reverse the current, and make it travel from 
&#8226;oath to north, and immediately the motion is 



checked, and more rapid moiion in the oppo- 
site direction is produced. By reversing the 
direction of the current, then I am able, to 
reverse the direction of the motion of the com- 
pass needle. I will place the current travelling 
from north to south, but under the needle, and 
the north pole will go away from me instead of 
towards me as it did before. I reverse the cur- 
rent once more, and now it will be going from 
south to north, and then we shall see, when it is 
below, the north pole will approach me. Now 
let me show you what conclusions you might 
legitimately draw from these facts. It has 
nothing to do with the vertical position, except 
that the pivot being vertical the magnet can 
only travel in a horizontal plane, therefore we 
must no' define the action as being dependent 
on the position of the current above or below. 
But I will give you a law which has been very 
generally used as a sort of aid to memory. If 
I be facing the magnet, and if my body be 
lying in the direction of the current so that I 
am as it were swimming with the current, the 
current coming in at my feet, and going out at 
my head, and if 1 be looking at the north pole. 
I shall see the north pole going to my left- 
hand side. Thht is a general statement that 
includes a statement for all cases. If it were a 
south pole I was looking at, it would be urged 
in the opposite way. 

Another thing which follows immediately 
from this observation of Oersted's is this ; it 
follows that each one of these poles is trying 
to go round the current. When I have the 
current near the compass needle the north pole 
is trying to go round the current, and would 
go round it continuously, but that it is restrained 
in its .-ction by its connection with the south 
poie. Therefore, I have both the north poie 
and the south pole wishing to go round the 
wire in opposite directions; they cannot go 
round in opposite directions because they are 
rigidly connected, therefore the most they are 
able to do ts to move in a position at right angles 
to the current. But we see clearly enough that 
if we could arrange scatters so that only 
the north pole was tending to go round the 
current, and the current did not extend over 
the south pole, then we should be able to get 
continuous rotation of the north pole round 
the current. I think you will agree with me 
that is a conclusion we naturally have arrived 
at, and which ought to be evident from the 
experiment of Oersted. I will try that experi- 
ment with a small piece of apparatus I have 
on the table. It consists of a magnet which 
is in a beat form. The vertical magnet Is

It &#9632; 




pivotted by a wire at the top and bottom. The 
current goes down through the top pivot 
alongside of the north pole, but it is stopped 
at the middle of the magnet, and carried away 
by a wire dipping into a trough of mercury so 
that it does not come down near the south pole. 
It passes only in the neighbourhood of the 
north pole. If our conclusion is right, that 
north pole ought to travel continuously round 
the current, and we should have continuous 
rotation ot this north pole round the current 
when we connect with the battery. The 
presence of the current is rendered evident by 
the luminosity of the little piece of platinum 
wire which is bent round so as to dip into the 
mercury cup. We find when it is adjusted 
that we shall get continuous rotation of the 
magnet round the current. I will now describe 
another experiment which is a simplification of 
this, a very remarkable thing, too. This con- 
sists of a compass needle north and south ; 
it forms its own axis, being pivotted top and 
bottom, but there is a platinum wire as before 
dipping down into the mercury cup which 
carries away the current from the middle of 
the magnet, so that the current only traverses 
half the magnet, then passes away, and does 
not come near the south pole. In this case 
also the north pole, which is at the top, ought 
to travel round itself. This experiment 
illustrates it equally well with the other, 
although it is a step in advance, perhaps. 
The north pole rotates round itself in a con- 
tinuous direction. 

It appears, then, so far as the action of the 
current on a magnet is concerned, it is this. 
There is a tendency to cause the north pole to 
move perpendicular to the direction of the 
current, and for the south pole also to move 
perpendicular to the direction of the current, 
but in an opposite way. In other words, the 
current has the power of creating magnetic 
force in its neighbourhood, that is, of in- 
fluencing a magnetic pole. If it has the power 
of creating magnetic force, we know that there 
are many things it is capable of doing, that it 
is not only capable of moving a magnetic pole, 
but that it is also capable of creating a mag- 
netic pole in a piece of iron. And you re- 
member in the experiments of last lecture I 
threw some images of iron filings or the 
screen in a magnetic field, and showed that 
the direction taken by those iron filings 
indicated to us the direction of the magnetic 
force ; so you will easily see that we ought, if 
we sprinkle filings round the wire, to be able 
to see these, lines of induction by circles round 



the magnetic pole. I will now throw this on 
the screen. 

When we have a current going through a 
coil of wire, making a ring of current, what is 
the condition of the magnetic force ? We know 
that any part of a coil through which the 
current is traversing is tending to move the 
north pole continuously round it in a cer- 
tain direction. Every part, then, of the 
coil of wire is tending to move north poles 
round the outside of the ring and in through its 
centre ; they all combine to tend to move the 
north pole through the centre of the coil. You 
remember that when I had this floating battery 
with this coil of wire attached there was a 
tendency for the magnet to suck this coil over 
itself, and now wc see clearly that the opposite 
effect is capable of being produced, and that 
the coil would naturally tend to create a 
magnetic force through its centre, and a com- 
plete magnetic circuit would be established 
round its outside, and back again through its 
centre. This action can produce certain effects. 
This creation of a magnetic field can cause a 
magnet pole to be moved, so that if we have a 
compass needle suspended inside this coil the 
current would tend to turn the needle at right 
angles to the coil, the north pole being moved 
through the coil in one direction, and the south 
pole being moved in the other direction. This 
is the principle of the construction of our gal- 
vanometers, of which I have one on the table 
here. We have two coils of wire both wound 
in the same direction, and the current circu- 
lates through these wires. On the central 
stand there is a compass needle which natunlly 
points north, parallel to the plane of the coils, 
but when the current is complete both these 
coils tend to move the north pole to the tight 
if the current is in one direction, and the south 
pole to the left, or the north pole to the left, 
and the south to the right if the current is in 
the opposite direction. This is one of the 
actions which a coil can produce owing to the 
magnetic condition of the space in its neigh- 
bourhood. 

Another thing which a magnetic force 
can do is to create noles in a piece of iron. 
Thus if I put this piece of iron into the 
centre of this coil, and if I hold a few 
iron tacKS in my hand under it, they ar^- 
not attracted, but if we turn on the 
current, those tacks will be attracted and 
hang there. The moment the current is 
broken the tacks fall down again, showing 
1h~* this coil, with a current passing through 
it, created magnetic ferce in its neighbour-

hood, and is also able to induce polarity in a 
piece of iron. 

The third action is the combined effect of 
the two. This coil has the power, when I 
suspend my iron by a piece of thread in front 
of, and co-axially with the coil, of creating 
polarity in the piece of iron, and then of 
causing the pole to move in accordance with 
the rules we have already described. On 
passing the current, you see the iron sucked 
into the coil. This sucking action is applic- 
able to a great many pieces of apparatus, and 
I might illustrate it by a small piece of appa- 
ratus which has been called an electric hammer. 
Here is a vertical tube, wound continuously 
with a coil of wire from the bottom to the top. 
At every fifth turn there is a separate wire led 
away to one of these pieces of brass, of which 
there are in all fifty round the stand. The 
lowest five turns are connected with the piece 
of brass next to t.ie ; the second five with the next 
piece of brass ; the third with the third piece, 
and so on, until the last piece furthest from 
me is connected to those coils which are 
at the very top of the column. If I introduce 
into this column a piece of iron, I have the 
means of causing any set of these turns of iron 
round the vertical column to have a current 
passing in them. The wires from my battery 
come to this piece of wood which has two con- 
tact pieces on it, and they just cover ten of 
these brass pieces on the flat board, so that 
by moving the wood along the flat board I 
make contact with the different pieces of brass, 
and I can send the electric current through 
any ten of these sets of turns which I please 
from the bottom of the vertical column right 
up to the top. Thus, if I introduce a piece of iron 
into the tube by making contact, and sending 
current through these coils, I can suck the 
ircn right up to the top, and drive it down 
with very considerable force. I put a piece of 
paper on the top of the tube, so that you may 
&#171;ee the rise of the ; ion. The force with which 
1 am able to bring it down produces a very 
considerable blow. The arrangement, of which 
this is a model called an electric hammer, 
was shown in the Munich Exhibition of 1882 on 
it considerable scale, but more as one of the 
&#9632;evidence.* of what we may expect the appli- 
cations of electricity to lead to than for any 
purposes which it served at that time. 

I have said that a study of these pheno- 
mena, resulting simply from Oersted's grand 
discovery, should lead us to many new facts 
even before we had performed the experiments, 
and I am going to ask you to think about that 



very connection in order that you may be led to 
one of Faraday's beautiful discoveries, and I 
believe that in so thinking over Oersted's 
experiment, and leading up to Faraday's great 
experiments, we shall bo following somewhat 
in the path over which Faraday travelled. 
Faraday never told us that he knew beforehand 
what results he was going to get. He always 
described his experiments simply as they camr, 
but at the same time I have little doubt he 
reasoned somewhat in this manner. We have 
found that a north pole tends to move in a 
certain direction round an electric current. 
Now it is a grand law which we have known 
since the time of Newton that action and re- 
action are always equal and opposite. Let 
me say a few words to show what I mean. If 
one of you and myself were sitting on twj chairs 
on casters connected by a rope, and I was to 
pull, you must not imagine that you alone would 
be pulled along the floor towards me, 1 also 
should be pulled towards you, or if you were to 
pull both of us would be moved towards each 
other. In every case whoever may do the work 
there is always a re-action equal, and opposite 
in direction, to the action. When a planet is 
going round the sun, the planet is drawn towards 
the sun by the force of gravitation, but you 
must not suppose that the &#8226; un is not also drawn 
towards the planet ; it most undoubtedly is. 
And although the mass of the sun is so 
great that its movement is small, the total 
amount of re-action is exactly equal to the 
action of the earth in moving towards the 
sun. When a stone falls from the hand 
towards the ground, it falls by the force of 
gravitation of the earth attracting it, but the 
stone is at the same time attracting the earth, 
and the earth moves in the opposite direction 
to the stone, and the total action which we 
observe by the fall of the stone is exactly equal 
to the reaction in that motion of the earth 
upwards to the stone, only the mass of the 
earth is so great that of course its motion is 
totally insensible. Now with these preliminary 
remarks, let us return to the experiments we 
have been considering. We find that a mag- 
netic pole tends to rotate round an electric 
current. We know that action and rea&lt; tion 
are always equal and opposite, therefore, 
before we try an experiment, we know with 
absolute certainty that a current will tend to 
rotate round a magnetic pole. This is the 
sort of argument which I have always imagined 
to myself Faraday must have used in studying 
Oersted's experiment as leading up to this 
beautiful experiment which he produced, show-

ing that an electric current rotates round a 
magnetic pole. This apparatus is exactly the 
converse of that smaller apparatus which 
showed us the other experiment. Here I have 
a vertical magnet with its south pole upper- 
most. Pivotted on the top of the magnet is a 
conductor, a piece of copper wire in fact, 
which travels parallel to the magnet, and dips 
down into a trough of mercury. The current 
then enters the magnet, goes up to the pole 
at the top, traverses the pivot, goes down 
the wire which is parallel to the magnet, 
but outside it, then into the mercury, and back 
to the battery. Now, when we turn on the 
current, we shall find that the wire is rotating 
round, showing the accuracy of the principle, 
that action and reaction are equal and oppo- 
site. I have only to change the direction of 
the current in order to show you that the 
motion is in the opposite direction. I shall 
now simply show you the effect of reversing 
the polarity. You noticed that the wire went 
round, if you looked down upon it, in the 
direction of the hands of a watch. I have 
now reversed the magnet, and put the north 
pole uppermost, and we shall find that the 
current, which is in the same direction, will go 
in the opposite direction. This experiment led 
Faraday to a large number of very beautiful ex- 
periments, all illustrating the same point ; but 
the general fact remains, that when we have 
an electric current in a magnetic field &#8212; that is 
to say, in a part of space where there is a 
magnetic induction &#8212; and cutting the lines 
ol magnetic induction, then there is a force- 
tending to move that current and tending to 
move the magnet, and whichever is free to 
move will move, and if both are free to move, 
both may move. I should like to say a little 
more about tau direction. I told you, when 1 
was using the suspended magnet, the law 
derived from Oersted's experiment was, that if 
you supposed yourself a conductor carrying a 
current, your head pointed in the direction of the 
current, and you looked towards the north 
pole, that then you would see the north pole 
moved to your left. Another way is to place 
the face of your hands with the palm towards 
the north-pole, and stretch your thumb away 
from your fingers, and point your thumb in the 
direction of the current so that the current may 
come down your thumb. If the current is coming 
from the point of your thumb towards your 
hand, and the palm of your hand is facing 
towards the north pole, then your fingers will 
show the direction in which the north pole of the 
compass tends to move. That is, peihaps, a 



little simpler than the way 1 previously de- 
scribed it. Another way has been put very 
clearly thus. Suppose you are using a cork- 
screw, you turn it round in the direction of 
the hands of a watch, and at the same time 
the corkscrew moves through the cork. Thai 
gives you a relative idea of the direction of 
the rotation, and a motion perpendicular to 
the plane of the rotation. Then I would say, 
when the current is going in the direction in 
which the corkscrew moves, that is into or out 
of the cork, then the north magnetic pole will 
be seen to turn in the direction in which the 
corkscrew turns. I give you these three rules 
because it is very easy to thoos- one of them 
and fix upon it, but you are apt to get con- 
fused if you do not fix on the one which you 
are going to use for the future. I recommend 
each one who has not a rule of his own for th&lt; 
purpose, to fix on one of these and keep to it 
as to the direction in which the compass needle 
moves. Then when you want to know in 
which direction the current moves, you always 
have to remember that by the law that action 
and re-action are always equal and opposite, 
therefore, under these circumstances, if the 
north pole tends to move in one direction, you 
knew that under the same circumstances the 
current tends to move in the opposite direc- 
tion. 

Now I must come to another set of pheno- 
mena ; the action of a coil on a piece of iron 
is to magnetise it, and this action tends t&#171;&#187; 
make that magnet move. In fact, the action 
of this coil is to create a magnetic field. The 
action of the cod is identical with the action ot 
a magnet. The magnet could be constructed 
of definite proportions which could behave in 
exactly the same way as this coil does on all 
external objects. 1 do not say on objects in 
the interior of it, because there there would 
be a difference, but on the exterior object. Ii 
the action of this coil and the magnet which 
could be made would be identical. Now if 
this coil attracts the magnet, and another 
coil will act as a magiet it is perfectly clear 
the two coils ought to attract each other. 
Each ot these coils before you is acting as a 
magnet, and, therefore, they ought to be able 
to attract each other, or to repel each other 
according to the position of their axes, and 
according to the direction in which the currents 
are rotating around the coils of wire. This is 
a part of the development of those grand re- 
searches which were undertaken by the French 
philosopher, Ampere. Ampen thought there 
ought to be some action between conductors

which carry currents of electricity, and on 
studying these actions he was able to bring 
out some general laws. He aimed at putting 
his conclusions in a certain definite form. He 
supposes we have two circuits, whether they 
arecoils, or whatever they may be, with electric 
currents, each little bit of a current in the one 
circuit was acting with some force or another 
upon each little bit of a current in the other 
circuit, and that the total action observed was 
the sum total of all these little independent 
actions. This was a very difficult way of 
attacking the problem. He did attack it from 
a purely mathematical point of view, and 
worked it out mathematically to find what 
law it wouil be necessary to assume in the 
action between little pieces of current in order 
that ill the phenomena which are observed 
might supervene. One result he showed to be 
that two little bits of current parallel to each 
other either attracted each other or repelled 
each other according as the directions of the 
currents in the two were the same or opposite. 
I have the means there of showing yo&#171;&#187; this by 
means of a flat coil of wire. The wire was 
simply wrapped between two boards, the wire 
being insulated and wound round itself con- 
stantly, always being coiled between two 
boards until we get a flat spiral of considerable 
size, and exposing a considerable surface, 
which might be subjected to an attracting or 
repelling influence. The suspension of the 
the coil is effected by means of the wire itself; 
the two ends of the coil are continued up to 
the beam over my head, and thence wires go to 
the batter)-, so that I am able to send a current 
circulating through that coil. I have here 
another coil or flat spiral, exactly similar to 
the one I have been describing. I have a 
battery also attached to this spiral, and a 
separate battery attached to the other spiral. 
The current is now circulating through the 
suspended coil, but there is no current at 
present circulating through the coil I hold in 
my hand. I bring this coil in the neighbour- 
hood of the suspended spiral, and there is no 
motion whatever, whether I hold one side 
towards it or the other. Now if we put on 
the current, you will see immediately an 
attraction. It draws the other spiral to 
it, and tries to stick to it ; on breaking the 
contact it flies away immediately. Here, 
then, is a case in which the two currents of 
electricity were circulating round these two 
coils in the same direction, and the parallel 
currents, going in the same direction, 
attract each other. Now we will reverse 



the direction of the current of electricity, 
so that the currents in the two coils will 
be going in opposite directions. I am now 
holding my coil close to the suspended one, 
and there is a violent repulsion when I 
bring the coils close together; they try to 
slide over each other, and get away from 
each other. I could get up quite a swing by 
following it about a little time, and I can 
check the swing by a judicious movement of 
the one I hold in my hand. I will now simply 
turn my coil round, and ask Mr. Davenport to 
put on the current in the same direction in 
which he had it just now, and there is imme- 
diate attraction. So that you see when 1 
reverse the position of the coil, I am doing 
exactly the same as if I had reversed the 
direction of the current by the commutator. 
We have attraction when the one current is 
circulating in the same direction, just as we 
always found that we had attraction when the 
current of electricity was rotating in the same 
direction in the two spirals. 

I will now show you by means of a piece of 
apparatus on the table, the truth of Ampere's 
conclusions, viz., that two parallel currents 
attract each other when they are going in the 
same direction, and repel each other when 
they are going in opposite directions. This 
piece of apparatus consists of a vertical column 
supporting at its top, on a pivot, a horizontal 
wire, which js then bent downwards, and dip* 
into a trough of mercury, the base of the vertical 
column. I shall be able to put on a current 
immediately, and the direction of the current 
I have carefully observed before. The current 
is coming frci the copper and going to the 
zinc of the battery, and goes up through this 
part of the external circuit. The current of 
electricity in the wire which I hold in my hand is- 
also going in the direction of the arrow which is 
attached to the conductoi I hold in my hand. 
The currents are now circulating in this direc- 
tion. In the first place 1 will keep both 
currents in the same direction. As I bring 
mine near the suspended one, you immediately 
see an attraction producing a rotation of the 
whole apparatus round the central pivot. I 
reverse the action by bringing it the other side, 
the two currents being parallel, and there is 
the same attraction, showing that two parallel 
currents going in the same direction attract 
each other. I will now steady it, and hold my 
current in the opposite direction with the point 
of the arrow dov.nwards, and cause the current 
to flow downwards whilst that in the apparatus 
goes upwards ; bringing them near to each

other we shall see there is a decided repulsion. 
These two main principles of Ampere's experi- 
ment appear to be true, viz., that two parallel 
currents attract or repel each other according 
as the direction of the currents are in the same 
or opposite directions. 

There is anotherpartof Ampere's conclusions 
to which I would also direct your attention. 
He also showed us that if two wires both carry 
currents, and cross each other, and if they can 
rotate about the point of intersection, then if 
the currents are going both to or both from 
the point of intersection, we have attraction. 
If one is going to and the other from the 
point of intersection, we have repulsion. 
I have an apparatus here which will show this 
action very well. This is a beautiful piece of 
apparatus which I happened to come across 
the other day. I daresay it is very common, 
but I never saw it before. There are two coils 
of wire, both on vertical pivots, and both 
capable of rotating about that axis. A cur- 
rent of electricity can be independently sent 
through these two wires. Both of them in 
rotating are able to make contact with mer- 
cury, which is contained in little cups. The 
ends of the one coil always dip into the same 
cups of mercury, and therefore the current 
always goes in the same direction through that 
coil. The ends of the other coil dip into a cup 
which has a partition, and the mercury which 
is in the cup rises by capillary force above that 
partition so as to meet ; and thus we have two 
mercury sectors into which the wires can dip, 
and this acts as a commutator tending con- 
tinually to reverse the direction of the current ; 
so we shall find that there is attraction tend- 
ing to bring the currents together up to a 
certain point. As soon as that point is reached 
the current is reversed, and then the force is 
converted into repulsion, tending to continue 
the rotation. By this ingenious device wc can 
get continuous rotation of these two coils 
round the vertical axis of two coils rotating in 
opposite directions. That illustrates the action 
I have just been describing, showing the 
attraction or repulsion between these two cross 
conductors at the top and at the bottom of 
the pivot, combined with the attraction of 
parallel conductors which are at the sides, 
and it forms a very pretty illustration of the 
principle. 

In conclusion, I will show you an experi- 
ment which further illustrates the attraction 
of currents for each other in a very simple way. 
I have upon the stand a spiral of copper wire 
forming a vertical coil freely suspended from 



its top. The lower end of the copper wire 
dips into a small vessel of mercury. Now 
when I turn on the current we know that 'here 
will be attraction between each one of those 
spirals and its neighbour, and the attraction 
is simply due to the creation of a magnetic 
field in the way in which we have evolved these 
things from Oersted's experiment. By the 
creation of a magnetic field there is an attrac- 
tion produced between the turns of spirals. If 
I were to put a piece of iron into the centre of 
it, the intensity of the magnetic field would be 
increased, but even without that there is a 
magnetic field created there producing attrac- 
tion between the spirals of this copper wire. 
The result is to lift the point right out of the 
mercury, so that if a current of electricity has 
passed through the spiral and lifts the spiral 
above the mercury the current of electricity 
would be stopped as soon as this action has 
commenced to take place. Immediately then. 
the currenthavingceased, the spiral resumes its 
normal length, and sinks again intot he mercury. 
Then the current acts again, a magnetic field 
is created, the attraction ensues, and it is 
lifted out of the mercury again, so that in that 
way it is alternately lifted and dropped at a 
very rapid rate. The sparkling indicates the 
change, and you can also hear it. I want you 
to notice the rapidity with which the sparklinp 
takes places which makes the action perfei tly 
evident.

Manganese ik Russia.&#8212; From an official repot t 
lately issucdit appears that the production of manganese- 
in Russia is steadily increasing. The exports for tlie 
first four months of this year amounted to 9,000 tons, 
as against 4,500 tons for the corresponding period of 
1885. 'ihis is shipped principally from Poti. where 
it is conveyed by the Trans:aucasian Railway from 
the mines, in order not to interfere wilh the petro- 
leum trade of the neighbouring port of Balcuir. 
&lt; living to the bad condition of the conveyance Mtd 
in transporting it from the mines at Tchiatoor to the 
Tran&amp;cauca&amp;ian Railway, large lumps of ore only can 
be carried, the result being that the smaller pieces, 
which are equal to two-thirds of the total quantit) 
extracted, are wasted, although equal in quality to 
that exported.

CANTOR LECTURES. 

THE MICROSCOPE. 
By John Mayaix, Jot. 

Lecture IV. &#8212; Delivered December 14, 1885. 

Modern Microscopes to the Date of 
the Application of Achromatism 
(Continued). 

Martin's "Pocket Reflecting Microscope." 
&#8212; This microscope (Fig. 53, p. IC56) was figured 
in B.Martin's "Micrographia nova "(Reading, 
1742, 4 to). The point of interest is the appli- 
cation of a screw-micrometer in the eye-piece, 
having a certain number of threads to the 
inch, by which accurate measurements could 
be made. Martin was, I believe, the first to 
provide accurate means of determining the 
exact magnifying power of any object-lens, so 
that the observer might state definitely that 
he used an amplification of a certain number 
of diameters. He describes his method thus : &#8212; 

"Take any Ruler, &amp;c, which has inches divided 
into Tenths, and place it under the Microscope so 
that you may have one of these Tenths in full View 
in the Image, then measure it carefully with the 
Micrometer, and count hov many turns were made 
in so doing ; divide that number by 5, and the 
Quotient will show how many times the Image is 
bigger than the Object. Thn&#171; suppose in Measuring 
one of those Tenths I make 40 Turns, that divided 
by S 1&lt;H&gt;tes 8 ; and so many times does the Micro- 
scope magnify with the gUw. A'ot*, the Reason 
why you divide by 5, is because there being 50 
Threads to an Inch, 5 must be equal to one Tenth in 
the Object ; therefore as many times 5 as there are 



in the Image, so many times must the Object be 
magnified" (pp. 12-3). 

This instrument had a mirror fitted in the 
cylinder-base, and was hence termed by 
Martin a "reflecting" microscope, though, in 
fact, it was a compound dioptric form. Martin 
regarded the base as a special point in the 
construction " for the instrument to stand 
upon." In later constructions the tubes were 
of brass, and the outer one was cut away to 
facilitate the placing of object-slides on the 
stage, and the mirror was hinged exactly as we 
see in the " Microscope a tambour," which is 
now largely manufactured in Pahs as a low- 
priced instrument. 

I do not think that any other microscope 
has a better claim than this one to be re- 
garded as the original form of the modern 
" drum " microscopes, which Frauenhofer re- 
vived in the early years of this century, and 
which was modified by Oberhaeuser into his 
well-known form of dissecting compound micro- 
scope. This latter hat gone through a series 
of alterations&#8212; conducted with admirable skill 
and foresight by Oberhaeuser, Hartnack and 
Pra2mowski, Zeiss, Nachet, sen., and his son 
and successor, Alfred Nachet &#8212; resulting in the 
general type of microscope known as the ' ' Con- 
tinental model," with which I believe it is no 
exaggeration to say that 90 per cent, of the 
useful microscopy of our time has been pro- 
duced. 

Martin's "Universal Microscope." &#8212; In 
the same work Martin figured and described 
his " Universal Microscope, mounted on a 
Ball and Socket " (Fig. 54, p. 1057). 

Martin appears to have considered his appli- 
cation of the ball-and-socket as of prime 
importance, and he introduces it with a 
criticism on the inconvenience of the "usual 
Construction of the large double Microscope," 
of the tall tripod form, referring, doubtless, to 
Culpeper and Scarlet's model. He claims that 
with his ball-joint ooe can " view all Kinds of 
Objects in every possible Position or Situation ' ' 
(p. 13). No fine adjustment was applied ; the 
focussing was effected (presumably) by sliding 
the body-tube within the sheath, D E. The 
"Quadrantal" stage, R Q, moved horizontally 
on the pillar, p, and the zone-section, v u.was 
of glass placed over an opening of similar 
shape in the stage and concentric with the 
pillar, hence " the Object, once well posited, 
is not moved, bat the Plate whereon it lyes 
passes thro' the whole Length of it under the 
Object Glass" (p. 15).

Martin devised numerous improvements in 
the mechanism and optical arrangement of the 
microscope. He appears to have suggested 
tks rotating multiple lens-carrier nosepiece, in 
which he placed six different powers to rotate 
successively in the axis, first applied to a 
simple microscope and later to a compound. 
The inveiition of the multiple system of pocket 
lenses is attributed to him. He applied to a 
simple microscope a fine adjustment (after 
Cuffs design, but acting on the stage&#8212; not on 
the optical body, with " the constant pressure 
of a Spring" to check the motion&#8212; (rife 
" Optical Essays," p. 9, Fig. XVI.). He also 
applied to simple and compound microscopes 
rack-and- pinion focussing adjustments; to 
the latter he added inclining movements to the 
pillar carrying the stage and mirror, and 
rectangular mechanical motions to the stage. 

Mat tin's Large Universal Microscope. &#8212; 
This instrument (Fig. 55) was formerly in the 
possession of the late Professor Quekett, who 
presented it to the Microscopical Society of 
* London. After a general reference to "the 
extent and variety of its accessory instruments 

"in which " it is perhaps one of the most 

complete instruments ever manufactured in 
this or any other country," Quekett describes 
the microscope as follows : &#8212; 

" This microscope .... standi about two feet in 
height, and is supported on a tripod base, a ; the central 
part or stem, B, is of triangular figure, baring a rack 
at the back, upon which the stage, o, and frame, i&gt;, 
supporting the mirror, e. are capable of being: roved 
up or down. The compound body, r, is three inches 
in diameter , it is composed of two tubes, the inner 
of which contains the eye-piece, and can be raised or 
depressed by rack and pinion, so as to increase or 
diminish the magnifying power. At the base of the 
triangular bar is a cradle joint, o, by which the 
instrument can be inclined by turning the screw-head, 
h [connected with an endless screw acting upou 4 
worm-wheel]. The arm, I, supporting the compound 
body, is supplied with a rack and pinion, K, bv which 
it can be moved backwards and forwards, and a joint 
is placed below it, upon which the body can he 
turned into a horizontal position ; another bar carry- 
ing a stage and mirror, can be attached b, the screw, 
L if, so as to convert it into a horizontal microscope. 
The stage, O, is provided with all the nsoal apparatus 
for clamping object!, and a condenser can be applied 
to its under surface ; the stage itself may be removed, 
the arm, P, supporting it, turned round on the pivot 
C, and another stage of eiquirite workmanship placed 
in its stead, the under surface of which is shown at q. 

"This stage is strictly a micrometeroue, having rect- 
angular movements and a fine adjustment ; the 
movements being accomplished by fine-threaded 



screws, the milled heads of which are graduated. 
The mirror, X, is a double one, and can be raised or 
depressed by rack and pinion ; it is also capable of 
removal, and an apparatus for holding large opaque 
objects, such as minerals, can be substituted for it. 
The accessory instruments are very numerous, and 
amongst the more remarkable may be mentioned a 
tube, it, containing a speculum, which can take the 
place of the tube, &#187;, and so form a reflecting micro- 
scope. The apparatus for holding animalcules or 
other live objects, which is represented at s, as well

as a plate of glass 6 inches in diameter, with four 
concave wells ground in it, can be applied to the 
stage ; so tuat each well may be brought in succession 
under the magnifying power. The lenses belonging 
to this microscope are twenty-four in number ; they 
vary in focal length from 4 inches to i-ioth of an 
inch ; ten of them are supplied with Lieberkuhns. 
A small arm, capable of carrying single lenses, can 
be applied at T, and when turned over the stage, the 
instrument becomes a single microscope ; there are 
four leasts suitable for thw pnptf*, their focal length

L^appear to have been spared in their construction. 
Krte are numerous other pieces of accessory appa- 
^^ratus, all remarkable for the beauty of their workman- 
ship." (" A Practical Treatise on the Use of the 
Microscope," 3rd ed., London, 1855, 8vo., pp. 
15.6). 

In addition to the movements described 
above by Quekett, the body-tube, with its sup- 
port, can be moved in an arc concentrically 
with the* axis of the triangular pillar, h, on 
the top of which it is fitted with worm-wheel 
and endless-screw mechanism, actuated by 
the screw -head below T. 

Though I cannot endorse Quekett's criticism 
on this instrument, namely, that " in poi.it of 
workmanship " it " can probably not be sur- 
passed, even in the present day," not even 
with reference to the workmanship of his day, 
for microscopes by Powell, Ross, Pritchard, 
Charles Chevalier, and Smith and Beck, were 
then constructed which were superior in every 
essential point of workmanship ; yet I must 
admit that Martin led the way far beyond his 
contemporaries, both in the design and the 
execution of this microscope. From my point 
of view, any detailed comparison of the design 
with that of our best modern microscopes 
.would lead to such a disparagement of Martin's 
'chef-tT cettvre, that I prefer not engaging upon 
the task. 

1 cannot, however, pass over Martin's work 
in connection with the microscope without 
calling attention to the fact that he was the 
first to construct an achromatic objective, and 
at a date so early in the history of tha appli- 
cation of achromatism that his priority as a 
mere question of date cannot be disputed. In 
his "New Elements of Optics" (London, 
1759, fivo), published iu the year following 
Dollond's communication to the Royal Society 
of his successfnl construction of an achromatic 
telescope (1758}, Martin dealt with the principle 
of achromatism, and after stating the results 
of his comparisons of achromatic telescope 
object-glasses with reflecting telescopes of the 
same magnifying power, in which he gave the 
preference to the latter, he informs us that he 
made a similar comparison between an achro- 
matic object-glass snd a speculum, applied as 
an object-glass in a compound microscope. 
He thus describes his experiment : &#8212; 

" Having found so great a Difference in the Appear- 
ance of Images formed in the solar Focus of a com- 
pound [achromatic] Lens and Speculum, I thought 



&#171;&#176;5&#171;) 



&#8226;I 

if 




I it would be necessary to compare the Appearance of 
the Images form'd in the proper or conjugate 
Focusses of a small triple [achromatic] Lens and 
Speculum, applied as an Object-Glass in a compound 

Microscope which I did by giving the same 

Length to the Images, and viewing them with the 
same Eye-Glasses ; and consequently the small 
Objects were equally magnified in the refracting and 
reflecting Microscope, but with how great a Difference 
in point of Clearness and Perfection in all the Circum- 
stances of Vision, those only will be able to conceive 
who shall try the Experiment themselves " (p. 96.) 

Martin states that he made similar com- 
parisons between " a double ac hromatic Lens, 
and a Speculum of the same focal distances " 
applied to a Camera Obscura, and also as 
" Solar Megaloscopes," and in each case the 
advantage was with the speculum. 

When we consider the severity of the tests 
he applied, and that even now there are 
astronomers who prefer the reflecting to the 
refracting telescope, we need not be surprised 
that Martin's achromatic microscope objective 
should have proved in his hands inferior to the 
reflecting microscope. The case could hardly 
have been otherwise, for reflectors up to a 
moderate size were nearly as well made then 
as they can be made now ; but the construc- 
tion of achromatic objectives for the telescope, 
microscope, &amp;c, was a quite new art, 
involving enormous extra difficulties of work- 
manship at that date. If we were to 
test some of our inferior 1 inch or 1-2 inch 
achromatic objectives against some of Cuth- 
bert's reflectors of the Mine magnifying power, 
I suspect we should have to endorse Martin's 
judgment in favour of the reflectors. 

But the question I have in view is&#8212; Whether 
or not we shall be justified in assigning to 
Martin the credit of the first production of an 
achromatic microscope-objective ? 

By his own admission he made one, and wc 
know that he published the fact in 1759, for 
the publication is before us. That he did not 
succeed in such a manner as to induce him to 
adopt the achromatic system to the exclusion 
of the older systems is a difficulty I admit ; it 
shows, at any rate, that he did not fully 
appreciate the value of achromatism in micro- 
scope-objectives. If he had sent his achro- 
matic objective to the Royal Society instead of 
publishing the re&#171;,ult of his comparison of it 
with a reflector (as cited above 1 , there can be 
no doubt he would have had full recognition a&#187; 
the inventor of achromatic microscopes, quite 
regardless of the mere quality of his work. 
If the criterion of invention be the first

Cuff 1 s Compound Microscope. &#8212; This micro- 
scope (Fig. 56, p. 1061) was figured and des- 
cribed by Baker (" Employment for the Micro- 
scope," 1753, 8vo, pp. 442-6) who considered it 
more serviceable as a working instrument than 
the tall tripod form c Mt*&#163;ipeper and Scarlet. 
The stage was more accessible, while the 
application of a fine adjustment of greater 
delicacy than any previously in vogue shows 
that Cuff aimed distinctly at improving the 
mechanical construction. The slotted tube, 1, 
carries a polished reflector, h, at the lower 
end, and is adjustable on the lower part of the 
body-tube for illuminating opaque objects. 
R is a conical diaphragm fitting beneath the 
stage. Q is a Lieberkuhn lens. 

Soon after the publication of this model, 
Adams and others improved upon it by apply- 
ing a cradle-joint to the lower end of the 
pillar, on which the instrument could be 
inclined ; the mirror was then attached to the 
pillar, first by a horizontal rod passing 
through it, and connected with the gimbal, 
and then, with the addition of an arm, 
giving lateral swiog. I believe Martin was 
the first to apply a separate stem, of square 
section, on which the mirror could be slid up 
or down ; then he made the mirror travel by 
rack-and-pinion on the standard itself, is we 
saw on his large Universal Microscope. 

Nairn* made Cuff's microscope in a very 
substantial manner, fitting it on a cradle-joint 
to shut down in a box ; and he was one of the 
first makers of compound microscope* to plan 
the instrument with a view to portability. 
Other opticians, both here and abroad, worked 
out various plans for rendering this microscope 
portable, such as by screwing the pillar 
within a box ; but Naime was the most suc- 
cessful, for his plan did not diminish the 
general stability of the instrument. Passemant, 
of Paris, copied Cuffs model exactly, in some 
cases gilding the metal work throughout , he 
also added ornamental scrolls, &amp;c, in one 
example I have seen, these ornaments were 
carried to the verge of absurdity&#8212; a not un- 
common defect in the designs of microscopes, 
.&amp;c, in France during the last century. 
&#9632; Baker states that in 1747 Cuff contrived a 
micrometer for his microscope, consisting of 
a " Lattice of fine Wires," distant from each 
other 1 -50th of an inch, and intersecting at 
right angles ; this was placed in the focus of 
the eye-lens so as to " divide the whole visible 



Area of the Microscope into Squares, whose 
Sides are each i^oth of an inch" (viae de- 
scription by Martin Folkes, P.R.S., id., p. 426). 

Folkes mentions that he had been informed 
that " silver wire may be had to make these 
lattices of, whose diameter is rather less than 
the seven hundredth part of an inch " (id., p. 
430). 

Ellis's "Aquatic Microscope" (made by 
Cuff).&#8212; In Ellis's "Essay towards a natural 
History of Corallines" (Lond., 1755), this 
microscope (Fig. 57, p. 106a) is figured. We 
have here the model which we may safely regard 
as the original from which our best forms of 
simple dissecting microscopes have been de- 
veloped. A disc of plane glass, c, or a con- 
cave, m, was applied on the stage on which 
dissections, &amp;c, could be made; a mirror, I, 
was fitted in a gimbal with a stem sliding in 
a socket in the pillar; the lens-carrier, F, 
alone, or with Lieberkuhn, r, screwed in a ring 
on the end of a horizontal arm, E, sliding 
through a socket, attached to a vertical rod, 
D, sliding and rotating in a socket at the 
back of the pillar for focussing, &amp;c. The 
pillar screwed on the lid of the box, within 
which the instrument was packed with sundry 
accessories. 

About 1835, Raspail was connected with a 
modified form of this microscope which became 
very popular in France ; the horizontal arm 
was made to move forward or backward by 
means of an internal screw controlled by a 
milled head at the back, and these movements, 
together with the rotation in the vertical socket, 
enabled the observer to view different portions 
of the object in .1 manner equivalent to the use 
of mechanical movements of the stage. The 
success of Raspail's model roused much 
jealousy among the opticians in Paris. Vincent 
and Charles Chevalier, then regarded as tin- 
leading manufacturers, took especial umbrage 
at certain laudator}' notices of the "new" 
microscope, and the latter addressed (April, 
1835) a communication of " Notes justifica- 
tives" to the "Academic Royale des 
Sciences," characterising the model as a men- 
plagiarism on Cuff's (Ellis's). Shortly after- 
wards, however, C. Chevalier proceeded to 
modify the instrument, improving it both 
optically and mechanically ; but, notwithstand- 
ing his efforts to disconnect Raspail's name 
from the design, it is still best known as the 
" modele Rarpail," and Chevalier's improve- 
ments have been almost wholly ignored. 
Andrew Ross applied a fine adjustment to his 
modification of this model.

Adams's "New Universal Single Micro- 
scope." &#8212; In Adams's "Microgr. illustr." (cited 
above), this microscope (Fig. 58, p. 1063) 
appears as the frontispiece. He introduces his 
description of the instrument as follows : &#8212; 

" It hath long been the Desire of the Corioui and 
Inquisitive Part of Mankind, to hare a Microscope 
which would be Portable and Universal, that is to 
say, Onk only Instrument, by which all Sorts of 
minute Objects might be observ'd" (p. 1). 

He tells us " This Microscope is made 
either of Brass or Silver, and is composed of 
six double convex Lens of different Foci " 

Fio. 



The disc, m m m, containing the six lenses, 
could be rotated in a collar-fitting on the top 
of the pillar, so as to bring the different 
powers to bear upon the object. N is au eye- 
guard connected with the top of the pillar by 
a short arm, under which the lenses pass, o 
is a "reflecting Speculum of Silver, or other 
Metal, highly polished ; which when an opake 
Object is to be viewed, must be placed under 
the Eye-piece N" (p. a). This reflector was 
not yet (1746) termed a " Lieberkuhn." 

The mirror, K, is supported by a hinge, v, 
in the centre of the back, on a short pillar, H, 
rotating in the disc, G. The feet, A and h, 
pivot on c, and fold under D for convenience

of packing. A fine adjustment screw 
through the pillar, and is actuated by a milled 
head, p, and connected with the stage. Adams 
remarks that " the screw p is to be turned as 
your hands and arms are resting upon the 
table, which is a conveniency to be met with 
in no other Microscope" (p. 5). 

The numbers engraved on the pillar " shew 
the respective Distances of the Object from 
the Magnifiers, according as each Glass 
magnifies more or less. For instance, if you 
use the 5th magnifier, first place it under the 
Eye-Piece N, and then with your Finger and 
Thumb turn the Screw P, till the Finger of the 
Hand which is engraved on the Sliding-piece 



Q, points to the Mark 5 on the Pillar ; then 
will the Object be very near its exact Distance 
from the Magnifier ; so that by a Turn or two 
of the Screw p, either backwards or forwards, 
to be found by trial, you may soon fit it 
exactly to your Eye " (pp. 2-3). 

The combination of this instrument with a 
heliostat, forming a solar microscope, was 
shown in Fig. 5 1 . The connection was made by 
removingthe mirror, f (Fig. 58), and the disc, 
o, from the front foot ; then the microscope was 
placed horizontally, and the conical-ended 
tube, forming a draw-tube to the solar appa- 
ratus, was screwed in the place of G, through 
the under side of the foot.

In practice, as a simple microscope, this 
large disc lens-carrier is very inconvenient ; 
in order to apply the eye close to the eye-

instruments I have examined, the stage was 
applied by means of a short stem at the back 
fitting in a hole, r., in the pillar, E (Fig. 58). 

Adams explains how "these two new 
microscopes are best illuminated by Candle- 
Light," using a globe of water as a condenser, 
" and if that should prove too glaring, as it 
sometimes does, interpose between the globe 
and microscope a piec: of thin oil'd paper, by 
which means most sorts of objects may be 
view'd as well by night, as in the day time" 
(id., p. 7), which plan was equivalent to that of 
Hooke, as used with sunlight. 

Adams's " Variable Microscope."&#8212; In the 
4th ed. (1771) of Adams's " Microgr. illustr." 
this microscope (Fig. 60, p. 106b) is figured and 
described (pp. i-vi. PI. II). Adams states that 
"We owe the construction of the variable 
microscope to the ingenuity and generosity of 
a noble person. The apparatus belonging to 
it is more convenient, more certain, and more 
extensive than that of any other at present 
extant; consequently the advantage and 
pleasure attending the observations in viewing 
objects through it, must be as extensive in 
proportion." 

In this instrument Adams claims to have 
embodied a number of improvements on all 
previous constructions. He applied ' two 
eye-glasses at A, a third near b, and a fourth 
in the conical p.-.rt between B and C," by which 
he increased " the field of view and of light ; " 
draw-tubes were at A and B, by which these 
lenses could be separated more or less. He 
also arranged the object- lenses, or "buttons," 
A and B, to he combined; seven "buttons" 
were provided, "also six silver specula 
" Lieberkuhns "] highly polished, each having 
a magnifier adapted to the focus of its con- 
cavity, one of which is represented at r," and 
the " buttons " could also be used with " any- 
one of these specula," by means of the 
adapter, D. 

The body-tube, A bc, with iU arm, F (in which 
it screwed at/), and stem attachment with the 
fine adjustment, were clearly modified from 
Cuff's design (Fig. 56). The large ivory head. 
1, actuated a pinion and rack for raising or 
depressing the body-attachment on the stem. 
The stage and mirror were adjustable on the 
&#187;tem. The large ratchet- w heel controlled by 
the pinion-handle, s, gave the required inclina- 
tion to the stem. 

Nos. 1 and 2 were ivory and glass " sliders " 
for objects, to be applied in the spring-stage No. 
3 fitting at T ; the " hollow at K [No. 3] is to 
Receive the gla.s tube No. 10." No. 4 was 



a diaphragm fitting in the lower end cf No. 3, 
" to exclude some part of the light which is 
reflected from the mirror Q." The forceps, 
No. 5, could be placed "in one of the small 
holes near the extremities of the stage, or in 
the socket R, at the end of the chain of balls 
No. 6." No. 6 was an arm composed of a 
series of ball-and-socket joints, similar to the 
system employed by Musschenbroek (Fig. 28), 
by Joblot, and by Lyonet, to which I referred in 
my remarks on Joblot's microscope, and 
was intended to bs applied at W, when- 
the stage was removed. No. 7 was a box of 
ivory in which discs of talc, and brass rings 
were packed ; No. 8, a hand-magnifier ; No. o, 
a sliding arm lens-carrier fitting on z, when, 
the instrument was required to be used as a. 
simple microscope ; No. 11, a rod of wire with 
spiral at the end for picking up soft object* 
from bottles. &amp;c. ; and No. 12, an ivory disc, 
black on one side and white on the other, 
fitting at T to carry opaque objects. 

To use the instrument as a simple micro- 
scope, the body-tube, a B c, was removed from 
the ring, f ; the lens-carrier. No. 9. was placed 
on z, and a lens with reflector, e. screwed in the 
ring, c ; the ball-and-socket arm, No. 6, was 
applied at w, by the part x, and the object 
held by either of the forceps could be turned 
and viewed as desired. For dissections, &amp;c. r 
the stage could be screwed on at F, and &#187; 
glass plate applied at T. 

One of the best examples of this design that 
I have seen, has a nose-piece with a slide 
carrying three objectives&#8212; the first arrange- 
ment of " triple nose-piece," or, indeed, of 
changing nose-piece for objectives (as dis- 
tinguished from simple lens-carriers), that h 
have met with. 

The inclining movements that were applied 
previous to the date of this instrument were 
generally defective. The ball-and-socket as 
employed with large microscopes by Hooke, 
Marshall, and Martin, could never have been- 
a really serviceable arrangement ; the cradle- 
joint at the lower end of the pillar, as em- 
ployed by Cuff, Adams, and Martin, though- 
better than the ball-and-socket, could not 
have been quite satisfactory. In the "Variable 
Microscope" Adams made a new departure 
as regards the mechanism of the inclining 
movement, by placing it far more under con- 
trol than any previous system. Were wc dis- 
posed to criticise this mechanism, we might 
easily show that Adams here applied an 
extremely complex system to arrive at a minor- 
result, and that he passed over feeble points h%

his design appaiently oblivious of their exist- 
ence. But from his above-cited statement 
Tie may fairly assume that he was not wholly 
responsible frr the design. Adams and his 
so.i (the author of the well-known " Essays on 
the Microscope "), and W. and S. Jones, were 
the originators of the model adopted by Vincent 
and his son Charles Chevalier for their early 
achromatic microscopes, and hence should be 
entitled to special consideration in any detailed 
estimate of individual services rendered to- 
wards improving the design of microscopes. 

Dellebarre's "Microscope Universel."&#8212; 
This microscope is shown in Fig. 61 (copied 





DELLEBARRE'S "MICROSCOPE UjlIVERSEI."(l777). 

from Harting's " Das Mikroskop," German 
trans., ^nded.,3vols., 8vo, Braunschweig, 1866, 
III., p. 123). The pillar was hinged at e for 
ordinary inclination, and at f to enable the 
body-tube to be placed horizontal, in the latter 
case the stage, ppp. could be inclined with 
the upper part of the pillar, or slid down below 
the hinge, when it would remain horizontal, 
and bottles, &amp;c, could be stood upon it. The 
body-tube, a be, was carried in a hinged ring, 
h, shutting by a spring-catch, and the screws, 
/and M, served to hold the body-tube firmly ; 
the ring, h, was attached to an arm, k, sliding 
through a socket, and could &#9658; fixed by the 



screw, /, the socket rotated on a long pivot 
fitting in &#171;, and a screw (not shown) fixed it. 
The stage was hinged to fold against the 
pillar, the condenser, u, was hinged to move 
laterally also (the hinge for the folding motion 
is not shown in the figure, but should be like 
/), and the mirror, on gimbal, similarly fitted, 
also folded against the pillar for convenience 
of packing. At c the long screw-thread is 
shown on which a Urge silver reflector was 
adjustable for illuminating opaque objects, to 
which I referred in my notes on Lieberkiihn's 
microscopes. 

This form of Dellebarre's microscope was 
applied by a long pivot fitting in the centre of 
a scroll tripod stand, the feet hinged to fold 
downwards ; in later models the lateral-folding 
tripod was adopted. Dellebarre also applied 
a rack-and-piuion to a movable socket con- 
nected with the stage, and adjustable by a 
clamp-screw on the pillar, which was a very 
inferior arrangement for focussing. In other 
constructions, however, he applied the rack 
in front of the pillar, which was a better place. 
Dellebarre's microscope was described in 
detail by Lalande {vide Montucla's "Hist 
des Mathemat," III., p. 5n ), and appcars to 
have been the subject of a special report to 
the " Academie des Sciences," in June, 1777, 
by MM. Montigny, Lc Roy. and Brisson. He 
was much commended for his application of 
six or seven lenses to be used in various com- 
binations as eyepieces. Lalande states that 
he deserved special credit for having con- 
structed a microscope composed of six lenses ; 
but hii description is too vague to enable us 
to say whether or not this design followed on 
the lines of that of Adams (Fig. 56). He 
dwells upon the fact that Euler had computed 
a combination of six lenses for a microscope, 
and also certain achromatic eye-pieces, and 
appears to imply that Dellebarre carried out 
the construction ; and he refers very distinctly 
to Dellebarre's "Large Achromatic Micro- 
scope" to be seen at La Haye, in 1771, and 
promises to treat of it later, in "Art. viii.," 
but on referring to Art. viii. I find nothing by 
which I can identify the instrument as an 
achromatic construction. I think Lalande 
must have been mistaken on the matter, for 
though I have examined upwards of twenty of 
Dellebarre's microscopes, some evidently of 
his early constructions, and some dated from 
Delft, as late as 1796, and Paris, 1805, I have 
never seen any eye-piece or objective of his 
of achromatic form. The value of the combina-

The general form of Dellebarre's instruments 
was much inferior to the best contemporary 
work produced in England. Fresnel, in hi.*

with a rack-and-pinion, as well as a rotary 
motion on the top of the stem. E, by which 
different parts of an object would be viewed 
better than with Jones's previous arrange- 
ment. The stage has clips to hold the 
objects, and an extra carrier, w, for discs of 
glass, &amp;c, pivots at s, so that the objects 
pass successively in the optic axis. The con- 
denser, 11. slides on the stem by the socket u,

I regard this form of microscope as the best 
that was produced in the last century, with the 
exception of Martin's " Large Universal Micro- 
scope" (Fig. 54, p. ro&lt;;7). of which 1 helipv* 
only two examples are known, and which hardly 
entered the field of competition. 

Jones's Radial Swinging Sub-stage.&#8212; -In 
the same work, PI. IX., this apparatus (Fig. 
64) is figured. F is the stage of a lucernal micro- 
scope, of which the axis passes through the 
socket, M, to the base-support ; G is a tail- 
piece swinging laterally by the socket, 11, on 
he axis of the stage, so that the illumination 



from the lamp, passing through the condensers 
1 and 2, strikes on the centre of the stage, and 
remains on it during the lateral swinging&#8212; 
thus providing radial illumination at all 
obliquities for transparent or opaque objects.. 
In the earliest form I have seen of this- 
apparatus, bearing the names "\V. and S. 
Jones," no lamp was attached to the tail-piece,, 
but a mirror was made to slide on it. 

Adams states that ihe apparatus was sug- 
gested by " the Rev. John Prince, LL.D.. now 
of Salem, Massachuset's States, North 
America," and that the lamp was attached to- 
it at the suggestion of Mr. John Hill, of Wells,. 
Norfolk. 

The modern swinging sub-stage, kn iwn as. 
Zentirayer's, which he exhibited at the 
Philadelphia Exposition, in 1876, acts on the 
same principle as the above ; and the addition 
of the lamp to the tail-piece of Zentmayer's 
form by Bulloch, of Chicago, was a revival of 
Hill's suggestion. 

Cut fiber fs Reflecting Microscope (A miefs 
formJ.&#8212;\n the early years of this century, 
Frauenhofer, Amici, and others, experimented 
with the construction of achromatic objectives, 
and, despairing of success in consequence of the 
difficulties of manufacture, they turned their 
attention to the improvement of reflecting, 
microscopes. Amici is said to have made such 
improvements in the latter, that even after the 
announcement (1824) of Chevalier's success- 
with achromatic combinations, he still worked 
at his reflectors. 

In England, Cuthbert, acting with the advice 
of Coring, brought the construction of reflecting 
microscopes to the highest point of excellence 
ever reached, improving even upon Amici's ;

I have examined several of these micro- 
scopes, and can testify to their general 
excellence. Cuthbert's work was superior 
to Aroici's, as I found by comparison. 

In concluding my notes on non-achromatic 
and reflecting microscopes, a few remarks 
may be made by way of resume". 

Of simple microscopes we may note that the 
earliest forms were mere hand-lenses. The next 
step was probably effected by mounting them 
at one end of a tube of card-board or wood, 



the object being held on a needle at the focus, 
or attached to a plate of glass, or between two 
plates, and viewed as shown in the " Micro- 
scopium Pulicare" {Vide Figs. 4, 23, &amp;c); 
for magnifying larger objects, the instruments 
shown in Figs. 7, 9, 10, and 11, were employed 
with more or less modification. Where higher 
power was needed, some system of focussing 
would be adopted, either by sliding the object- 
carrier or the lens. For still higher power, 
where the difficulty of making the lenses would 
limit the power, globules of blown-glass were 
used; the first production of such globules 
was by Toricelli {vide Poggendorffs " Hist, de 
la Physique," p. 357). Hooke gave detailed 
instructions for making these globules, and he

appears to have partly ground and polished 
them. The names of Rutterfield (1678) and 
Delia Torre (1765) appear in the "Phil. Trans." 
in connection with various processes they de- 
vis-d foi the production of these globules, and 
the latter was said to have been specially suc- 
cessful in making very small ones. In some 
cases the globules were melted on the end of a 
needle or fine silver wire in a spirit-flame and 
left adhering, so that they could be handled with 
facility. Another and apparently hrtt*r plan was 
adopted by Sivright (1829), who placed a frag- 
ment of glass on a minute hole in a thin plate 
of metal, and then by means of a blow-pipe 
and spirit -flame melted the glass so that it ran 
through the hole, and with careful manipula- 
tion it was said that a serviceable lens could 
be produced having a small diaphragm in its 
centre, the plate thus forming a substantial 



mount for the lens. But the uncertainty of the 
successful production of these globules must 
have struck every serious worker; and thus 
we find that Leeuwenhoek used only lenses 
with ground and polished surfaces, and except 
in the matter of mounting such lenses in cells 
so as to be more conveniently applied or 
changed, no essential improvement was made 
in their construction until Wollaston, Brewster, 
Goring, Herschel, Tully, and Coddinrton 
&#171;urked out by theory and practice the best 
forms and combinations of simple lenses, re- 
sulting in the well-known "Doublets," 
"Triplets," the "Herschel combinations," 
the " Bird's-eye" or " Coddington," the 
"Stanhope," the " Crossed lens, " &amp;c, all 
produced between 1790 and 1830, i.e., during 
the years when the possibility of applying 
achromatism to the microscope presented

iUelf to the same investigators, with the addi- 
tion of Beeldsnyder, Van Deyl, Fraucnhofer 
Amici, Selligue, and the Chevaliers, as a pro- 
blem to be solved by practical constructions. 

With regard to the sequence of construction 
in the period of nearly two centuries we have 
dealt with, we cannot affirm that in either 
the optical or the mechanical design the 
construction of compound microscopes pro- 
gressed steadily from generation to generation. 
Until about 1824, the optical arrangement 
seems to have drifted about almost aimlessly, 
with little or no reference to any question of 
the theoretically best forms or combinations. 
In Hooke'b microscope the field -lens was 
applied or withdrawn without any apparent 
conception that a combination might be de- 
vised of permanent service, and during the 
next hundred years the compound eye-piece 
was hardly improved. The improvement then 
initiated was in the more accurate mounting 
of the lenses rather than the adoption of a 
better optical system. 

Then with reference to the object-lenses for 
compound microscopes, from the date of 
Hooke's instrument (1665) to the end of the 
1 8th century, plano-convex, or bi-convex lenses 
were used almost hap-hazard. In the few cases 
where a combination was attempted, the ex- 
periments &#187;etm to have been limited to the 
rude system of placing tbe plano-convex lenses 
with their convex surfaces as close together 
as possible ; and even this improvement de- 
vised by Divini, and carried somewhat further 
by Christopher Cock, and by Grindl, led to no 
permanent advancc-the suggestion died out. 
If we examine a consecutive series of object- 
lenses produced during this period, we shall 
find Campani used a biconvex lens placed 
loosely in a wooden cap, with a small central 
hole, which was screwed on the nose-piece, 
the lens accommodating itself to the axis 
without reference to any exact process of 
centering. In the Hocke instrument the 
nose-piece was a small cylindrical tube of 
brass, and the end wa3 made slightly concave 
(perhaps accidentally) ; the lens was placed in 
wuwuij, Aua &lt;t uuaa cap wun a plane 
perforated end was slid over it. In Divini's a 
similar arrangement was adopted. Later on 
the lens was held in its cell by a sprung- 
ring, as in Marshall's, and the higher powers 
were mounted between two perforated con- 
cavities moulded in small cups of thin sheet 
silver or brass, the cups being held in the cells 
by sprung-rings ; and this latter system was 
applied to the lower powers also by Culpeper, 



Cuff. Adams, Martin, Dollond, and others, the 
perforations in the plates serving as dia- 
phragms, for the opticians soon found that with 
compound microscopes small diaphragms were 
essential to render the image tolerable to the 
eye. In the mean time, in England, and on 
the Continent especially, many compound 
microscopes were made with wood, ivory, or 
horn nose-pieces, in which the lenses were 
sometimes dropped and held by a sprung- 
nng, or on which perforated caps of similar 
materials fitted by screws. Whatever system 
was adopted, the result was that the lens 
had not the slightest pretence of being exactly 
centered. Toward* the end of the century 
Martin, Adams, DolVnd, and Jones, in Eng- 
land, and Dellebarre and others on the Con- 
tinent, began to mount the lenses in accu- 
rately fitting cells, in some cases burnishing 
them in immovably, 2s was commonly done 
with achromatic telescope object glasses. This 
latter plan was adopted also for the lenses of 
the eye-piece. There can be no doubt that 
the severe attention to accuracy of optical 
workmanship required for the successful pro- 
duction of achromatic telescopes had much in- 
fluence on the microscope, especially in Eng- 
land, where the best opticians generally con- 
structed both telescopes and microscopes. 

As to the mechanical construction, no regu- 
lar progress was made, and this was probably 
due (1) to the small number of microscopes 
manufactured, and (2) to the difliculty of com- 
munication, whence the opticians were in- 
formed of the improvements devised by their 
rivals by printed or era) descriptions only, and 
seldom had the opportunity of actually in- 
specting the instruments. The large body- 
tubes, with draw-tubes of the early construc- 
tions, imply that low powers were generally 
used; and conversely, as the body tubes were 
diminished in diameter, higher powers were 
employed, for here the extra-large field would 
be useless so far as definition was concerned. 
The fluctuations in the application or the 
omission of fine adjustments point to the fact 
that no pressing need was felt for delicate 
focussing; the extremeiy minute diaphragms 
applied to the object-lenses would account for 
this partially. And again, the fact that very 
little original and difficult investigation was 
attempted with the microscope&#8212; the majority 
of instruments serving for the merest dilettanti 
purposes only&#8212; would indicate that the instru- 
ment was seldom sufficiently familiarised to 
betray its weak points ; hence the progress in 
the design was slow and intermittent. It may

appear strange, but it is nevertheless true 
that on examining the proboscis of a blowfly 
with the Campani microscope (Fig. Ia ), which 
I believe was made befo-e ,665, 1 cannot say 
that the image was inferior in, definition, with 
equal magnification, to that given by micro, 
scopes by the whole series of makers preceding 
the general application of achromatism (i8a 4 - 
&#171;ojo). . T 

The application of achromatism infused new 
and vigorous life into the use of the micro- 
scope, and gave a great impetus to its develop- 
ment, both optically and mechanically, as we 
shall see. 



Achromatic Microscopes. 
I have already stated that B. Martin pub- 
hshed the fact of his having constructed an 
achromatic microscope objective, and have 
cited from his "New Elements of Optics" 
0759). the passage wherein he described the 
result of his comparison of the objective with 
a reflector giving the same magnification. It 
does not appear that Martin followed up the 
subject beyond the trials he then described, 
though in the same volume he promised to treat 
of the theory and practical construction of 
achromatic objectives for the microscope, and 
refers us to a later portion of his treatise, where 
we find the matter briefly alluded to (Part VI 
P- 1 14) and dismissed.

the difference in the mechanical constructions 
was hardly distinguishable. Frauenhofer also 
attached the microscope on a box, thus ren- 
dering it more secure in use. 

In 1815, Amici worked at achromatic micro- 
scopes, and abandoned them entirely in favour 
of reflecting instruments until after the pub- 
lication of Fresnel's favourable report on the 
construction of Selligue's achromatic ob- 
jectives, in 1824. 

C. Chevalier, in his " Notes Justificatives " 
(Paris, 1837, 4to), gave a summary of dates 
relating to the early history of the achro- 
matic microscope, from whi-h I select those of 
which he probably had personal knowledge :&#8212; 

''&#8226;) In 1823-4, Messrs. Vincent and Charles 
Chevalier made an achromatic microscope 
with four doublet lenses superposed, according 
to the piaus of Selligue, who exhibited it at 
the " Academie des Sciences " [on April 5, 
1824]. 

(*&#9632;) In 1824-5, Messrs. Chevalier exhibited 
at the "Societe d'encouragement " their im- 
proved " Microscope d'Euler." 

(.?&#8226;) In 1827, Amici exhibited in Paris his 
horizontal dioptric microscope, the novelty of 
which was much admired. Amici applied a 
series of oculars, camera; lucid.e for drawing, 



a movable object-carrier, and "very good" 
superposed achromatic objectives, but of 
longer focus than those of Messrs. Chevalier. 

(4-) In 1827, a few months after Amici's 
visit. Messrs. Chevalier exhibited at the Louvre 
an Amici ' &#9632; microscope of their construction, 
which was highly commended by Arago. 

Selligue's Achromatic Microscope.&#8212; 
Selhgue (1823) was the first to suggest the 
plan of combining two, three, or four plano- 
convex achromatic doublets of similar foci one 
above the other, to increase the power and the 
aperture, which plan was carried out for him 
by Messrs. Chevalier. 

Fresnel, the eminent mathematician, was 
appointed to make a special report on Selligue's 
microscope (Fig. 68) to the " Academie Royale

touched" and improved by Selligue), and up 
to a magnification of "two hundred times" 
Selligue's was decidedly superior; beyond 
that limit Fresnel did not find the achromatic 
superior to the non-achromatic&#8212; '&#8226; the contours

fig- 1 shows the instrument arranged as a 
horizontal microscope. The right - angled 
prism for deflecting the rays into the horizontal 
body-tube, R, is within the angle-tube, V x. 
The coarse adjustment is effected by rack- 
and-pinion, o, to the stage, and a fine adjust- 
ment screw, q, with ball-socket bearings, is 
also applied to the stage by means of an estra

racks on the stem by the pinion, n. The 
stage has rectangular motions, actuated by 
mechanism similar to that known in England 
as the "Turrill" system The body-tube 
pivots laterally at a, to facilitate changing the 
objectives; the draw-tube, r, is moved by a 
rack-and-pinion at u. In Fig. 2 the angle- 
tube, vx, containing the prism is removed, 
and an adapter, v, is substituted, in which the 
objective, y, is screwed, then the body-tube is 
raised to the vertical by means of the hinge, c, 
and on removing the pin, o {Fig. i), the 
instrument can be inclined on the cradle-joint 
on the top of the pillar. Fig. 3 shows the 
adaptation of the horizontal body-tube for the 
observation of chemical reactions, &amp;c. ; the 
angle-tube, vx, is turned upwards, and an 
extra stem carrying the rack stage. /, the 
mirror, g, and the routing disc of diaphragms, 
*, is applied by a socket, d. Fig. 3 bis shows 
the application of a stage, /' /&#8226;, carrying a 
disc of glass, o, to be heated by the lamps, 
mm. also for the ohvrvation of chemical 
reactions. &amp;c. Fig. 4 shows the ordinary 
dioptric arrangement of Fig. 2, but inclined to 
the horizontal, and a powerful compound con- 
denser, ss\ applied to rack on the stem. In- 
F 'g- 5 we find a condensing lens., it, c.j jointed 
arms, connected with a socket, d, sliding over 
the tube, x. for illuminating opaque objects. 
In Fig. 6 a silvered glass " I.ieberkuhn " is 
shown. In Fig. 7 polarising and analysing 
prisms are shown. Fig. 8 shows the combina- 
tion of the body-tube with Amici's reflecting 
microscope, the tube, 1 1', carrying the specu-

earner applied on the stage to bring the 
objects close to the tube. Fig. 9 is the con- 
denser (/ of Figs. 1 and 2) with disc of 
diaphragms. 

This microscope was directly traceable to 
the application of achromatism. Chevalier 
applied numerous pieces of accessory appa- 
ratus to the instrument, such as a screw stage- 
micrometer, eyepiece micrometer, a series of 
different eye-pieces, compressoria, &amp;c. Inde- 
pendently of the diversity of the movements, 
the wljulc mechanism evidences care and pre- 
cision, entitling Chevalier to high praise.

applied rack-work focussing to the lens-

mirror (plane and concave) ; his principal tm. 
provement was the rotating disc of diaphragms 
fitted beneath the stage.

Between 1820 and 1835 the English opticians 
Tully, Pritchard, Dollond, Andrew Ross, and 
Powell, encouraged by the advice of Wollastnn. 
Brewster, Goring, and others, worked out in- 
numerable combinations of single and com- 
pound lenses to be used as simple micro- 
scopes. In some cases lenses were made 
of sapphire, spinel, aod diamond, which 
Brewster and Goring seemed *o think would 
supersede all other forms of single lenses, or 
even achromatic combinations, for simple 
r.iicroscopes, by reason of the greater working 
distance their higher refractive indices gave 
with equal magnification. Pritchard devoted 
special attention to these "jewel" lenses, 
carrying the focus as high as 1- 100 inch ; but 
the difficulties of manufacture were so great 
compared with the production of glass lenses, 
and theirgeneral utility was so small compared 
with that of compound microscopes, that they 
were abandoned. 

Schick's Microscope.&#8212; About 18281835, 
Schiek, of Berlin, and PkessI, of Vienna, 
and Pistor, carried out the general form of 
microscope shown in Fig. 72. The body- 
tube here travels by means of an arm 
and rack-and-pinion socket on a stem of 
triangular section, on which the stage and 
mirror are also carried. In some cases a 
&#187;ne adjustment was applied to the stage 
after the design of Cuff's, or again to the 
travelling-socket&#8212; systems more or less compli- 
cated, and persevered in, as it would seem, 
from sheer unwillingness to abandon obsolete 
forms of mechanism. 



The stem, however, may have suggested to 
Andrew Rsss some of his earliest designs of 
large microscopes, in whicr, he mounted thi- 
body-tube, stage, and mirror on a bent stem 
(bent to provide space for a large sfege), carry- 
ing the body-tube on the upper part and the 
mirror on the lower part, so as t* be on the 
same axis, which construction preceded, I 
believe, the suggestion of a s : mih\r design' by 
Jackson.

conjunction with Trecourt and Bouquet, 
brought out the instrument shown in Fig. 
7J (p. 1078). Oberhaeuser' s design was evi- 
dently based on that of Frauenhofer's "Drum " 
microscope (Fig. 67), but the modifica- 
tions and improvements were so great as 
to overwhelm Frauenhofer's slight modifica- 
tions of Martin's original constructions of the 
last century; so that Chevalier's attempt to 
fix upon Oberhaeuser the charge of being a 
mere plagiarist is absurd&#8212; hardly needing 
consideration. 

The application of the socket-support, /, for 
the body-tube, and bracket, /, connecting it 
with a second socket, A, mounted as a sheath 
on a pillar through which a fine adjustment 
screw, k, acted for focussing, was in itself an 
improvement of first-rate importance; Ober- 
haeuser, however, combined this improvement 
with another equally important one, by mount- 
ing the pillar on a plate made to rotate on 
the optic axis on a drum-base, and serving as

ments in the mechanical design of the com- 
pound microscope entitling Oberhaeuser to a 
conspicuous place among the inventors who 
have sought to perfect the 'nstrument. 

For the purpose intended, i.e., as a com- 
pound dissecting microscope, no instrument 
of previous date was made at all comparable 
with this of Oberhaeuser's for convenience. 
The stage was so well supported that the 
dissecting operations could be observed with- 
out the slightest trace of flexure or tremor, 
e/en with the hands resting on the edge; 
whilst the convenience of rotating the object 
so as to view each part most favourably, and 
without lateral movement in the field, must

have presented itself as a new and most im- 
portant advance to the microscopists of that 
date. The success of the model was, I 
believe, quite unprecedented in the history of 
the microscope. The design was copied by 
the Jngenieur Chevallier, Lerebours, Soleil, 
and Xachet, senior, with modifications prin- 
cipally with reference to the mechanism of the 
sub- stage ; in some cases the sub-stage was 
mounted in a gimbal actuated by a lever, 
in others a rack-and-pinion movement was 
applied, and here and there more convenient 
means were applied for changing the cylinder- 
diaphragms or the condenser. Prisms were 
occasionally applied to the body-tube either to 
form a horizontal arm or to be more or less 
inclined. Rack-and-pinion movement was 



applied to the body-tube by Oberhaeuser in 
addition to the sliding socket ; and a siuiiLu 
movement to the draw-tube (first devised, I 
believe, by Dr. Cuno Fischer, of St. Petersburg) 
made a " pancratic " arrangement. 

Hartnack' s Microscope (Oberhaeuser's 
form). &#8212; The substitution of the horse-shoe 
base and pillar (Fig. 74) for the drum-base of 
Oberhaeuser's model was, I believe, carried 
out by Hartnack, Oberhaeuser's nephew, and 
was evidently devised to facilitate the use of 
oblique light. With the drum-base the mirror 
remained in the axis, and thus could not be 
used to provide oblique light beyond a 



Fio. 74.

few degrees from the axis, depending on 
its size and focus ; but the horse-shoe base 
allowed the mirror to be swung on a 
pivoted arm sliding in the pillar, which was, of 
course, an improvement. The cylinder-dia- 
phragms or a condenser were contrived to fit in 
a sliding sub-stage, with a cylindrical socket 
which can be centered to the optic axis by the 
optician, but which the amateur adjusts with 
much difficulty. In the early models of this 
design the focussing-screw remained, as before, 
at the lower end of the pillar, and then the micro- 
scope could not be inclined ; Hartnack moved 
the actuating milled head to the top of the 
pillar, so as to permit the application of a 
horizontal axis to the upper ends of the pillars

On which the body-tube, stage, and tail-piece 
could be inclined. 

Thi&#187; form of microscrope has been generally 
adopted on the Continent, and is known as the 
"Continental model." Asa working instru- 
ment, the general design is, in my opinion, the 
most serviceable extant. That the mechanical 
arrangement is susceptible of improvement, I 
have no doubt; for example (i), the base is 
not safe when the stage and body-tube are 
inclined (which difficulty has been met by 
Nachet and Zeiss, and others, by extending 
the base behind the pillar supports) ; (2) the 
sub-stage should be applied to the tail-piece 
with rack-work and centering arrangement*, 
on the plan adopted in the better class of 
English microscopes ; (3) the fine adjustment 
screw is far too rapid in action for high powers ; 
(4) a convenient mechanical stage is needed] 
that can be readily applied or removed (my 
next Figure shows a design I have suggested 
for this purpose).

Mayall's Mechanical Stack. 

Mayall's Mechanical Stage.&#8212; The aim of 
this device is to provide mechanical move- 
ments for the object-slide, without the use of 
travelling plates. The slide is placed on the 
surface of the stage (in the Oberhaeuser form, 
or on the rotating stage-plate of the usual 
English model), being held in a hinged frame 
connected with the mechanical movements. 

The apparatus is shown in Fig. 75, as made 
by Swift and Son ; it is attached to the sur- 
face of the stage by the milled-head screws 
shown at either end of the lower part. The 
curved arm on the right, and the straight arm 
on the left, are hinged with sprung fittings like 
the blades of a pocket-knife. As the slide 
lies in contact with the surface of the stage 
(or of the rotating stage-plate), the flexure 
that is found more or less in every form of 



mechanical stage, acting by one or more 
superposed plates, is obviated. 

In practice I have found it advisable to gum 
a narrow strip of paper near the ends of the 
under surface of the glass slides, to remedy 
the inconvenience due to any unevenness of 
surface.

ELECTRICITY. 

By Professor George Forbes. 

Lecture V.&#8212; Delivered May 15, 1886. 

In my last lecture I commenced by shoving 
you the remarkable experiment which was made 
by Professor Oersted, of Copenhagen, and 1 
proceeded to tell you that nearly all the 
phenomena of electro-magnetism, which have 
been the foundation of the great progress in 
electrical science and its applic.iuor.s since 
that date, could have been deduced from that 
experiment of Oersted. Oersted's experiment 
has been spoken of by some as having been an 
accident. At the moment that he saw the 
m.luence which a wire carrying a current had 
&#171;jn a magnet he was trying to detect the 
influence in a totally different manner, he was 
trying to detect the influence of the heat 
generated upon the magnet, but instead ot that 
Ke found the remarkable result which formed 
the basis of our demonstrations in the last 
lecture. It has been said by some that | 




Oersted's experiment was the result of an 
accident, but I protest against any such inter- 
pretation being put upon it. It shows a com- 
paratively feeble knowledge of the means of 
progress in scientific discovery. It is by such 
constant labour, and the readiness to grasp 
the importance of unexpected phenomena that 
present themselves, that the greatest discoveries 
have been made. Were we to say that the 
philosopher studying in his laboratory at 
numerous experiments, when he first happens 
to come across something he had never found 
before, and tests it, and finds it to be a new 
fact&#8212; were we to call that an accident, 
then forsooth we should have to say that the 
discovery of the planet Uranus was an accident, 
that the discovery of the many continents and 
islands of the world, and half the discoveries 
of philosophers in their laboratories, have been 
accidents. As the result of that brilliant 
discovery of Professor Oersted, we saw 
last week that several conclusions could be 
drawn. The continuous rotation of a mag- 
netic pole round an electric current, the 
motion of a wire carrying the electric current 
in the neighbourhood of a magnet, and the 
attraction or repulsion of two parallel cur- 
rents according as they were in the same or in 
opposite directions, these discoveries of Faradav 
and Ampere are the necessary conclusions 
from Oersted's experiment. At the same time 
that does not detract in the least from the 
originality or the merit of these great men who 
followed out the experimental work, and proved 
the truth of these facts which were new to 
science. And so it is in the present day ; fre- 
quently we find new discoveries which, upon 
investigation, are found really to be deducible 
from what we knew before, but that in no &#187;ay 
detracts from the merits of those investigators 
who by their laborious researches have intro- 
duced facts which were new at the time to 
science, and especially is this the case in 
electrical science. Frequently we have new 
facts presented to us&#8212; tacts which nonj of us 
before have been acquainted with, and it is 
common to say, &#171; Oh, such facts are perfectly 
deducible from the theory of electricity." That 
may be so, but it does not in the least detract 
from the value of these new researches. 

I will, with your permission, before going on 
to the question of induced currents, which is a 
mere continuation of the deductions which were 
made from Oersted's experiment, illustrate the 
subject of the last lecture by means of a 
different apparatus&#8212; a piece of apparatus of 
great beauty, and one which with the same

THE MICROSCOPE. 
By John Mayaix, Jpn. 
Lecture V.&#8212; Delivered December 21, 1885. 
Achromatic Microscopes (Coni inurd). 
I have said that the application of achroma- 
tism to microscopes by Tully, in England, 
appears to have at once shown the need of 
better mechanism, and that he commenced 
the improvement by applying steadying rods 
to the body- tube, and mechanical movements 
to the stage. Then, as the apertures of the 
objectives were increased, and the focal planes 
became correspondingly shallower, it became 
necessary to apply a more sensitive system 
of focussing than any previously employed. 

Cuff's system of a direct - action screw 
moving the socket-support of the body-tube, 
which Martin adapted to act on the socket- 
support of the stage, fell into disuse for com- 
pound microscopes, and during many years 
was superseded by the rack-and-pinion motion 
variously applied. The Cuff-Martin system 
was still used as far as tho early years of 
this century for simple microscopes, such as 
Jones's "Pocket Botanical and Universal 
Microscope," where two or three single lenses 
were pivoted on a pillar, to act singly or to- 
gether over a stage and mirror, which differed 
from Ellis's Aquatic Microscope only in minor 
points, contrived specially to render the instru- 
ment more portable. 

In Cuthbert's Reflecting Microscope we 
saw the Cuff-Martin focussing screw applied 
to the stage ; and in Chevalier's " Microscope 
Universel " a similar, though improved, 



arrangement was employed; md in Schick's 
microscope, Pistor's, and Ploessl's, I have 
stated that inferior plans, somewhat similar, 
were persisted in during several years, when 
far more accurate and better focussing systems 
were generally known. 

On the Continent, the direct-action screw 
seems to have found much favour and it 
would not be difficult to select from the micro- 
scopes that are known a series directly con- 
verging to the plan employed by Oberhaeuser ; 
but we have other matters to engage our 
attention. 

In England, the Cuff-Martin focussing 
screw was not much used with achromatic 
microscopes ; indeed, it may be said to have 
died out with Cuthbert's Reflecting Micro- 
scop.. Our opticians began by improving 
the rack-work, so that great precision of 
focussing movement was thus attained, a 
precision which has, on the whole, been 
steadily maintained down to our own time, 
and which the American opticians&#8212; judging 
from the rack-work of Tolles, Zentmayer, 
Grunow, Bulloch, Bausch, Lomb, and 
others that 1 have examined &#8212; have at 
least equalled. But, however well the nck- 
work was made, still more sensitive means 
were required for focussing, and the opticians 
attacked the problem with much energy. 
An immense number of devices resulted, some 
of which are bizarre iu the extreme as well as 
ingenious ; in others the ingenuity has been 
tempered by distinctly practical aims, and in 
a very small minority of cases the practical 
aims have been so well supported by mechanical 
skill and experience, that great success has 
been attained. 

Among the bizarre contrivances for fine 
adjustment, there is one arrangement which I 
notice on account of its singularity, and be- 
cause it is one of the most recent, and devised 
in the face of our modern systems as if in 
defiance of all the experience, optical and 
mechanical, of which we stand possessed &#8226; I 
allude to D'ArsonvaPs system of water 
focussing, where the fine adjustment is effected 
by pumping more or less water into a specially 
arranged body-tube. Other bizarre systems 
have consisted principally in the applications 
of cat-gut to actuate the mechanism, or, again 
of levers of extraordinary length acting on 
the bodytube, causing it to tilt towards or 
from the object. This latter system has had 
(and still has) its equivalent in systems em- 
ployed by Amici, and Nobert, and others 
where the stage has been made to tilt upwards

or downwards, i.e., obliquely in relation to the 
optic axis, by the action of ? screw, the 
upward motion being- sometimes due to the 
spring of the bent stage-plate itself (as in one of 
Amici's models), or to a spiral-spring raising 
the stage-plate on a hinge ; and in some cases 
&#8212; notably in Nobert's model&#8212; the stage was 
suspended on two points serving as pivots, and 
a lever beneath, acted upon by a screw passing 
through the pillar, caused the upward motion, 
the reverse motion acting by gravity alone, so 
that, in practice, the position of the microscope 
was intended to be vertical only. These and 
analogous contrivances were mostly designed 
to economise the expense ; from any other 
point of view they cannot be approved. 

A less objectionable plan waj devised (by 
Oberhaeuser, I believe, but I have met with it 
in microscopes of early date by C. Chevaiier, 
and by Pritchard-ir. the latter case bearing 
strong evidences of Chevalier's workmanship), 
\ here the stage-plate was raised or depressed 
at right-angles to the optic axis, by a direct- 
acting screw, with or without the combination 
of a spiral -spring encircling it within a sheath. 

Our earliest real designers of fine adjust- 
ments for the compound achromatic micro- 
scope, James Smith, Andrew Ross, and Hugh 
Powell (I purposely exclude Cornelius Varley, 
for, in my opinion, most of his contributions to 
the mechanism of the microscope bordered so 
much on the bizarre, that their influence has 
rather retarded than advanced the best points 
of construction), seem to have been undecided 
as to the best position for the fine adjustment ; 
hence we find very early, and apparently con- 
temporaneous, efforts made to apply the move- 
ment to the nose-piece by a conical-ended 
lifting screw, and to the stage by means of a 
moving Lame with three wedges, acted upon 
by a screw, variously placed (for which me- 
chanism Powell was awarded the Silver Isis 
Medal bythe Society of Arts in 1834). Or.again, 
modifications of Oberhaeuser' s system were 
tried, either by a screw acting directly on the 
sheath-support of the body-tube, or in con- 
bination with a short lever at the back, or the 
screw passed through the tail-piece, and the 
actuating milled head was at the end. In 
these latter modifications Powell does not seem 
to have taken part ; his best early models had 
the fine adjustment applied to the stage, as 1 
have noted, and it is only justice to him to 
admit that, as a focussing movement, his 
mechanism acted with great precision &#8212; a pre- 
cision hardly surpassed at the present day. 

At this early period the best microscopes 




were made of what would now be regarded 
as unwieldly size&#8212; veritable monuments of 
mechanism. Smith and Ross built up their 
great models without any apparent intention 
of simplifying the movements. We find me- 
chanical stages of six or eight inches diameter, 
and two or three inches in thickness, with con- 
trolling pinions projecting horizontally two or 
three inches laterally, or at the back, or 
shortened somewhat, and applied vertically 
beneath by means of brackets or angle-pieces, 
the arrangements defying description. In 
some of Powell's models we find his "Turrell " 
stage-mechanism with two screw stage-micro- 
meter movements acting at right angles, and 
the focussing movement all combined in one 
stage. 

I cannot determine who first applied the fine 
adjustment to the nose-piece. I have met 
with very early models by Powell, with a coni- 
cal-ended screw lifting Uie nose-piece by the 
contact and movement of the coned surface ; 
and he appears to have tried various positions 
for the actuating screw, placing it even near 
the eye-piece. Ross appears to have tried the 
plan now known as "Jackson's" fine adjust- 
ment earlier than 1835, accoiding to the recol- 
lection of some opticians I have met, who were 
connected with the manufacture of microscopes 
at that date ; and he appears also to have- 
mounted the socket-carrier of the body-tube on 
a strong stem with rack, bent in the middle to 
provide space for a large stage, and continued 
beneath the stage, in a manner quite analogous 
to that known as the "Jackson" form. 

It seems to be generally admitted that Ross 
devised the plan of carrying the body-tube on 
the end of a hollow cross-bar on the top of, and 
at right angles to. the rack-stem, which was 
planned to enable him to use his system of 
fine adjustment consisting of a fine screw with 
large milled head, acting by a point on the 
long arm of a lever, the short arm of which ends 
in a fork in contact with a stud on either side 
of a cylindrical sJiding -tuoc, forming the nose- 
piece of the body tube in which the objectives 
are screwed ; a spiral-spring presses down 
the nose-piece, and it is against this pressure 
that the screw and lever act. 

This system appears to be the first really 
sensitive focussing applied to the nose-piece ; 
and it was, and probably still is, the most 
delicate system ever applied to the microscope. 
It has had a long period of popularity, and it 
still survives applied to Powell and Lealand's 
microscopes, which are generally considered, 
by experts in the use of the microscope, to stand

alone in their excellence for all purposes where 
extreme exactness and delicacy are needed. 

The rival system of fine adjuament-the 
short lever and screw applied externally to the 
body-tube -kno*,, as the &#171; Jackson " system 
which seems to have been contrived to allow 
the body-tube to be supported more substan- 
Ually on the limb or stem, has had its merits 
ably realised in the microscopes of Smith and 
Beck and their successors, and by Tolles, of 
Boston and, except as modified by the present 
firm of Ross (Schroeder's form, which we shall 
examine later on), I believe the consensus of 
opinion among the experts in manipulation 
I that it has been superseded by other 
plans applied to the &#187; Jackson " form of micro- 
scope. 

As I could not illustrate the various phases 
of the development of these fine adjustments 
without far more time and space than could 
be properly assigneu for the purpose, I have 
thought it advisable to pass over this period 
with these general remarks, and come at once 
to the best typical example evolved by the 
combined efforts of Ross and Powell, and 
shall, therefore, ask your attention to Powell 
and Lealand's microscope; premising, how- 
ever, that it represents not only the best points 
of construction devised by Andrew Ross, but 
other and better points added or modified by 
Messrs. Powell and Lealand. We shall ex- 
amine several phases of construction of the 
*' Jackson " form later on, and compare them 
incidently with this microscope. 

Powell and Zealand's Microscope.- In this 
instrument (Fig. 7 8, p. ,098) we have a broad 
tnpod base, forming the most substantial sup- 
port ever devised for a microscope without 
unduly mcreasing the weight; the position of 
the horizontal (inclining) axis is such that the 
balance of the instrument is well maintained 
from the vertical to the horizontal. 

Th*&#187; coarse adjustment is effected by rack on 
a large prismatic stem, moving within a sheath 
or box through the front of which passes the 
horizontal axis ; on the top of the stem is 
attached the cross-arm carrying the body- 
tube&#8212; the cross - arm enclosing the lever- 
mechanism for the fine adjustment, as devised 
by Andrew Rcss. This cross-arm is much 
longer than that used by Ross, and thus 
carries the body- tube more forward, so as to 
provide radial space for the complete rotatiou 
of the stage on the optic axis, while, at the 
same time, the lever of the fine adjustment is 
lengthened, and greater delicacy of motion is 
secured witiiout rendering the actuating screw 



1097 



or otber parts of the focussing mechanism too 
fragile for long service. 

The stage has mechanical movements on 
the "Tun-ell" system, which Powell first 
constructed for Edmund Turrell, and for which 
the Society of Arts awarded a medal in iSja; 
it also rotates completely on the optic axis by 
means of an obliquely placed pinion acting on 
a bevelled rack on the inner face of the stage- 
ring, supporting the mechanism. " Finders " 
are engraved on the plates, and the main 
support of the stage-ring is graduated for 
an K Je measuring, a pointer on the ring mark- 
ing the amount of motion in arc. 

The sub-stage is carried by rack-work, and 
has rectangular centering movements, sup- 
porting an inner socket that can be rotated by 
rack-and-pinion, in which sub-stage apparatus 
is placed. In the latest models, a fine adjust- 
ment by screw-cone and stud is applied by 
means of an extra slide in front of the rack 
slide. 

The m.rror (plane aid concave) i&#171; mounted 
in a half-gimbal, with two arms and a socket 
sliding and routing on the tail-piece, and a 
clamp-screw fixes it where required. 

The stage is attached to the sheath of the 
stem by a special arrangement of screws, by 
which the rotation in the op:ic axis can be 
centered; and sliding spring-clips, and a 
removable and adjustable angle-piece to hold 
the slides, are applied on the upper surface. 

The body-tube is phrotrd to move laterally 
on the top of the stem, and a 1 adjustable steel 
stud beneath serves to stop the movement in 
the axis. 

In venturing to note upon what I consider to 
be points where improvement might be made 
in the desig.. of this microscope, I feel that I 
must be &#8212; 

"&#8226;'&#8226;&#8226;&#171; &#8482;&#171;fal of my notion, 
Uk* the ikater on thin ice that hardly bear, fci&#8482;.- 



for it represents the result of nearly fifty years 
steady devotion to the perfecting of the instru- 
ment by Powell and Lealand, embodying at 
the same time the best ideas of mechanism 
and design by Andrew Ross. 

I find the mechanism of the stage movements 
always in a condition of flexure, due to the 
system of superposed plates sliding in grooves ; 
and I think some such system as that I have 
suggested (Fig. 75, see ante. p. 1079) would 
get rid of the flexure, especially if the surface 
of the rotating stage-ring were of ghus, with- 
out in any way diminishing the command over 
the movement of the object-slide. By dis- 
pensing with the moving plates, the thicknes.

of the sup would be considerrbly reduced, J immersion system-net needing other adjust- 



and the arrangement would be available for 
supporting some useful form of oblique illu-

diaphragms, stops, &amp;c, to be used above the 
sub-stage condenser. 

Before we come to the other English and 
American microscopes designed to compete with 
Powell and Lealand's as instruments of the 



highest class, I must note that they have all 
been very considerably influenced by t"&gt;e con- 
struction of Zentmayer"s "Centennial" Micro- 
scope, exhibited at the Philadelphia Exposition , 
in i8;6, in which the Uil-piece was arranged

to swing laterally on an axis, in a line cutting 
the optic axis in the plane of the object on the 
stage. Zentmayer's idea was, I believe, quite 
original so far as he was concerned, though, in 
fact, it was a revival of Jones's system, shown in 
Fig. 64. Singularly, too, the idea had been 
realised in a different manner by the late 
Thomas Grubb, in a microscope he devised in 
,8 5J. patented in 1854, and which he improved 
in 1858, and described firstly in vol. v. of the

GruddS Sector Microscope. -In this micro- 
scope (Fig. 79 ) the principle of radial 
illummation was shown in the application of a

almost wholly unnoticed in Kngland until 
about 1880. Asa working instrument, I should 
say there are very few points in it that would 
now commend themselves for imitation. In 
my opinion, however, for the purpose of radial 
illumination, Grubb's sector is a more 
serviceable system than that employed by 
Zentmayer. With the sector, the adjustment 
of the illumination can be effected without 
causing the image to sway about in the field, 
because the illuminator is practically free from 
contact with the stage ; but with Zentmayer' s 
swinjrinj? tail-piece, suspended, as he devised, 
on a tubular sheath through which the cynical 
axle-support of the stage passes, every touch 
on the mirror or substage is translated into 
unsteadiness in the image. 

Zentmayer' 's " Centennial" Microscope.&#8212; 
This microscope (Fig. 80, p. 1101) was con- 
trived by Zentmayer, of Philadelphia, to pro- 
vide greater facilities for oblique illumination, 
by mounting the sub-stage and mirror or arm 
suspended as I have just described. 

The fine adjustment is effected by means 
of a second slide, behind the slide of the 
coarse adjustment, which is acted upon by a 
lever (within the bent limb) and screw. This 
system of fine adjustment which acts sensi- 
tively only in the vertical direction, and does 
not respond to the backward motion of the 
screw where the instrument is inclined to the 
horizontal &#8212; the downward motion acting by 
gravity only &#8212; was employed by Grunow, in a 
microscope which I examined more than ten 
years ago.andwhichhad then been made several 
years. The principle of making the delicate- 
fitting slides of the fine adjustment bear the 
weight and rough usage of the "Jackson" 
coarse adjustment, seems to me wholly defective. 
No arrangement of this kind that I have ex- 
amined would bear any critical testing. 

As to the particular mechanism of the swing- 
ing tail-piece contrived by Zentmayer, I have 
already said that I regard it as inferior to 
Grubb's sector arrangement. 

With this microscope, Zentmayer supplied 
two extra stages, one with mechanical and 
rotary movements, the other of special thinness, 
with rotary movement only, for diatom work. 
The workmanship is excellent, as also that of 
the * Tilghman " friction-stage shown in the 
figure. The mechan'cal stage, however, is so 
contrived that the rotating plate is mounted 
on the top of the plate actuated by the 
mechanism of the rectangular movements, 
so that the rotation has no direct correspond- 
ence with the optic axis ; that such an 



arrangement should have been devised for a 
modern instrument entering the lists as a first- 
class miscroscope, is another item which 1 
cannot approve. 

Bulloch's " Congress " Microscope [second 
form).&#8212; In this instrument (Fig. 81, p. 1102) 
Bulloch improved upon Zentrmyer's design 
by attaching the stage to the limb by an angle- 
piece, so as to be tree from the tail-pieces, of 
which two are applied, one for the sub-stage, 
and one for the mirror. 

The arrangement for carrying the lamp, so 
that the illumination can be moved con- 
centrically with the object on the stacre should 
be compared with that shown in Jones's Radial 
Swinging Tail-piece (Fig. 64). 

Bulloch modified Zentmayer's fine adjust- 
ment by applying a box-fitting to the slide, 
and by adjusting a spiral-spring to give the 
downward motion ; but the arrangement is 
utterly vitiated by carrying the coarse adjust- 
ment on the front of the delicate slides of the 
fine adjustment. 

Tollis's Microscope with Vertical Disc- 
In this microscope (Fig. 82) Tolles mounted 
the stage on a disc, the centre of which 
corresponds with a line cutting the optic axis 
in the plane of the object on the stage. Near 
the edge of the disc the substage travels in a 
groove, carrying the condenser in arc round the 
object as a centre, in a manner analogous to. 
that shown in Grubb's Sector Microscope 
(Fig- 79)- 

For obtaining radial illumination on the 
object, this arrangement of Tolles's is an 
elaboration of his Traverse Substage, which I 
have long regarded as the best practical acces- 
soryapp.iratusthat has been applied forthe pur- 
pose. Some of the details of the construction, 
which depend to a great extent on the applica- 
tion of the disc, do not commend themselves 
to me ; for example, I find the narrow zone on 
which the substage is supported far too weak, 
and the attachments and general mechanism 
of the substage are too slight, so that the 
centering-screws, diaphragms, &amp;c, cannot b&lt;&gt; 
touched without betraying flexure. 

in later constructions of this form of micro- 
scope, Tollesapplied a mechanical stage acting 
by two plates about 1-50 inch in thickness, 
actuated by two pinions vertical to the surface 
of the stage. By this arrangement of the 
pinions, the movements were effected entirely 
within the circumference of the stage, so that 
a complete rotation of the latter was obtained 
without the necessity of carrying the body-tub.- 
more forward. In previous constructions of th&lt;-

" Jackson " form, the rotatory movement of a 
large mechanical stage, with lateral projecting 
pinions, had always been stopped on either 
side by the limb. 



When this stage was examined by Mr. 
Wenham, he at once proposed to improve the 
mechanism by removing the lower of the two 
plates, and by combining the pinions on one

axis&#8212; a modification of the " Turrell " form&#8212; 
which we shall sec adopted in the Ross- 
Wenham Radial Microscope. Tollea also 



worked out practically the same system ; but, 
as a matter of fact, he was preceded by Mr. 
Wenham. In Tolles's later form he gave

greater rijridity to the stage by adding a flange 
to the upper edge that gradually increased in 
thickness towards the shoulder by which the 
stage was attached to the vertical disc ; by 
this arrangement the stage remained very 
thin&#8212; hardly more than 1-8 inch&#8212; and the 
under surface was plane, so that the manipu- 
lation of apparatus beneath was as free as 
possible. Swift and Son have adopted this 
plan of strengthening the stage in one of their 
recent models. 

In Tolles's later microscopes we find an extra 
radial arm mounted on a second disc, behind 



the large one, to carry the mirror ; this was 
applied as a ready means of condensing light 
on the surface of the stage, or for utilising a 
second beam of light for particular resolutions. 
Tolles devised many arrangements for oblique 
illumination ; his best apparatus of this kind 
was the "Traverse Substage," which con- 
sisted of a graduated semi-circle of brass, 
having a hemispherical lens applied slightly 
below the centre of the arc, and in a zonal 
groove near the edge a carrier is fitted to slide 
and carry a small condenser. This contrivance 
is made to rack in the place of the usual sub-

stage, and the hemispherical lens is adjusted 
in immersion contact with the base of the slide ; 
then the movement of the condenser in the 
zonal groove from the axis to near the horizon 
of the hemispherical lens gives the required 
obliquity of illumination, slight touches of the 
mirror directing the light through the con- 
denser. Tolles also applied a system of prisms 
to this device, so as to reduce the amount of 
adjustment required of the mirror; and he 
added other hemispherical lenses of different 
radii for use with various classes of work ; a 



special arrangement of collimated diaphragms 
was also adopted for measuring angles of 
aperture by means of a lamp or candle carried 
in the zonal groove. In the roost complete 
form of this apparatus, he applied two socket- 
carriers for condensers, placed about 45 apart, 
and in one example I have seen, the intention 
was to dispense with the ordinary stage of the 
microscope, and employ the Traverse Substage 
alone.

Substage as an accessory apparatus would 
wholly supersede Zentmayer'., swinging tail- 
piece and similar contrivances. 

The body - tube and fine adjustment of 
Tolles's best microscopes were of the 
"Jackson" form; I may, therefore, say a 
few words on the comparative merits of this 
and of the Powell and Lealand form. 

From my point of view, the choice of one or 
the other form, considered as microscopes of 
the highest class, must necessarily turn on 
the question of the best r^ne adjustment. With 
equally good fine adjustments, the preference 
will certainly be given to the " Jackson " form, 
on account of the greater stability of the body- 
tube, and the less liability to injury. Every 
other point of excellence in the Powell and 
Lealand form is perfectly applicable to the 
" Jackson," or to well-known modifications of 
it. Assuming that Tolles made the "Jack- 
son " form as well as any other optician of our 
time&#8212; and his skill in workmanship did not 
fear rivalry&#8212; then the fine adjustment, not 
being at all comparable in delicacy and pre- 
cision with that of Powell and Lealand. I am 
forced to the conclusion that it is not the work- 
manship that is at fault, but the principle. 

One of the best manipulators known with 
the microscope in our time was the late Dr. 
J. J. Woodward, of Washington, who was 
frequently pressed to state his objection to the 
"Jackson " form of instrument His invariable 
answer was that he had never found the 
focussing sensitive enough to enable him to 
use it for photo- micrography with high powers. 
Tolles's Clinical Microscope. &#8212; A small 
microscope (Fig. 8j, p. noj) was devised by 
Tolles for clinical purposes, which seems to me 
so good in every way that 1 must ask special 
attention for it. The objective is screwed on 
a tube sliding within the one shown, and, for 
roughly focussing, the sliding motion suffices ; 
for fine adjustment, the sheath is made to turn 
on a fine screw-thread on a cylindrical tube, 
which serves also as a socket-carrier for the 
stage. The compound microscope is here 
reduced to the simplest form 1 have net with 
to be a really serviceable instrument for the 
purpose in view; and the mechanism is of 
thoroughly substantial character. The stage 
fits in the socket-carrier by a short tube, and, for 
portability, is removed, and a metal cap sub- 
stituted, to exclude dust from the objective ; a 
fubf cap covers the eye-piece. I commend 
this model to the notice of our opticians. 

Beck's "International" Microscope. &#8212; In 
this microscope (Fig. 84, p. 1 105) Messrs. Beck 



have added a movement to Tolles's vertical 
disc, by which the centre can be raised or 
depressed to correspond with the thickness of 
the slide. The stage can also be turned to 
the inverted position by rack -and -piqion. 
Whether or not these modifications are of real 
service I will leave others to decide. 

The fine adjustment is modified from that 
known as Zentmayer'3, and is open to the 
same objection, inasmuch as the delicately 
fitted slides have to carry the coarse adjust- 
ment, body-tube, &amp;c. 

Watson's Microscope (Crossley's form).&#8212; 
In this microscope (Fig. 85, p. 1 106) we have an 
innovation in the method of obtaining radial 
or concentric illumination, designed by Mr. 
F.dward Crossley, F.R.A.S., and constructed 
by Messrs. Watson. 

The light from the lamp is projected into 
the hollow trunnion-axis of the microscope 
wilh the aid of a bull's-eye condenser, and by 
a right-angled prism, A (vuie Diagram, Fig. 86, 
p. 1 106), placed in the centre of this axis, is 
reflected forwards in the direction of the axis 
on which the swinging tail-piece turns. The 
arm of the swinging tail-piece is made in the 
form of a box, and carries a second similar 
prism, B. in the axis on which it moves, so as 
to intercept the rays of light coming froni the 
first prism and reflect them in the direction of 
the arm or box. At the other end of the 
box is a third prism, C, which reflects the rays 
of light forward on to the mirror, D, whence 
they are di rated to the object, E, on the stage. 
The dotted line represents the direction taken 
by the rays after reflection from the prism 
within the trunnion-axis. 

It will Uius be seen that no change in position 
of the microscope on its inclining axis affects 
the direction of the light trom the lamp, and 
also that in all positions of the swinging tail- 
piece, whether above or below the stage, the 
illumination remains constant upon the object. 
Thus (apparently) the greatest facility is given 
for illuminating the object at any angle, and 
seeing which is rans' suitable. 

I have not tested this arrangement of prisms 
for oblique illumination, and therefore cannot 
speak of it from personal experience. I should 
however, expect such a design to require a 
general accuracy of constniction in the 
mechanism and in the adjustment of the 
prisms, quite beyond the average found in our 
best microscopes.

where the plane of the object cuts the optic 
axis, t.e., a roint situated about the thickness 
of an ordinary object-slide above the centre

of the surface of the stage. (2.) A lateral in- 
clination of the limb to either side upon an 
axis attached to the centre of the sector ; tiie 
centre line of this axis prolonged forward also 
intersects the optic axis in the plane of the 
object on the stage. (3.) A rotation of the 
instrument on its circular base, the optic axis 
being the centre of motion. 

The leading principle followed in the con- 
struction of the stand is that when it is in- 
clined backwards (as in Fig. 88, p. 1 109), or 
laterally (as in Figs. 89, 90, and 91. p. 1109), 
or rotated on the base-plate, a pencil of light 
from a fixed source will always reach the object, 
all the movements, whether separate or com- 
bined, radiating from the object (or the pro- 
longations of its axes) as a centre. 

The stage rotates completely, and is a modi- 
fication of Tolles's (to which I referred in 
my notes on his microscope with vertical 
disc. Fig. 8a), in which the rectangular 
motions are effected by milled heads vertical 
to the surface of the stage, and entirely within 
the circumference. It is mounted on theZent- 
mayL-r system, and graduated near the edge, 
and "finders" are engraved in convenient 
positions ; two centering screws are provided, 
by which exact rotation on the optic axis can 
be secured ; and it can be easily removed, or 
may be replaced by a glass or metal friction- 
stage, &amp;c. A simple and effective plan has 
been adopted of applying the iris-diaphragm, 
hemispherical immersion illuminator, &amp;c, be- 
neath the stage, where they are held by a 
small projecting peg and a spring -latchet. 

The sub-stage can be removed entirely from 
the lower part of the limb by means of a cham- 
ferred sliding plate. Rectangular (centering) 
and rotating motions are provided. 

The coarse adjustment is of the " Jackson " 
form, by means of a spiral pinion and diagonal 
rack-work. 
I will deal with the fine adjustment later. 
In illustration o* the variety of motions 
obtained with this microscope, Fig. 88 shows 
the sector inclined at about the usual position 
for working with central illumination. Fig. 89 
shows the lateral inclination of the limb, &amp;c, 
the sector being at its highest position. Fig. 
90 shows the Zentmayer twinging tail-piece 
clamped to the sector (as suggested by me), 
the limb being inclined laterally, and the sub- 
stage removed ; this lateral inclination of the 
limb causes the stage to revolve upon a central 
horizontal axis, so as to present the object to 
the illuminating pencil at all obliquities in 
altitude, while the rotation of the stage would 



give illumination in all azimuths. Fig. 91 
shows the sector at the lowest point, so that the 
microscope-body is horizontal, the tail-piece 
being clamped to the sector, the limb swung 
laterally about 45? (to the right), and the 
sub- stage removed ; this position of the sector 
would be that required for measuring angles of 
aperture by means of the graduations on the 
circular base. The axis of the lateral inclin- 
ing motion is also graduated, so that either 
the degree of inclination of the limb or that of 
the swinging tail-piece can be registered. In 
all these positions, and, indeed, in every position 
in which the various movements enable it to 
be placed, the microscope is very steady. 

Since Figs. 88, 89, 90, and 91 were made, 
an arm i.as been attached to a rotating piate 
in the centre of the lower base-plate to carry 
the lamp on a pillar, as in Fig. 87. 

The fine adjustment shown in the four small 
figures consisted of a vertical chamferred slide, 
carrying the nose-piece only, and controlled 
by milled heads on either side of the nose- 
piece. This arrangement was subsequently 
replaced by an entirely new design of adjust- 
ment by Mr. Wenham, consisting of a V-slide, 
acted upon by two " snail "-cams, between the 
edges of which revolved a steel roller, forming 
the axis of, and controlled by, a large milled- 
head passing longitudinally through the slide 
of the coarse adjustment, and projecting 
slightly on either side, in a convenient position 
for work. The V-slide was fitted within the 
body-tube, and carried at its lower end the 
nose-piece; it was pressed downwards by a 
spiral -spring, against which it was moved by 
the revolution of the cams. 

In practice, however, it was found that the 
steel roller actuating the cams was liable to 
slip when the movement had not been in use 
for a few days, and Messrs. Ross engaged 
Dr. Hugo Scbraeder to design a new system, 
which is shown in Figs. 92 and 93 (p. 11 10). 

The nose-piece, A, is attached to a tube 
which is fitted to slide accurately in adjust- 
able bearings in the body-tube, it. The nose- 
piece tube has a short projecting arm, C, by 
means of which it is pressed upwards by a 
strong spiral-spring mounted in a cylindrical 
box, L, outside the lower end of the body-tube. 
The arm, C, is moved against the spring by 
the differential-screw mechanism (with milled 
head, d), which is gimballed on a bracket, E, 
attached to the upper part of the body-tube. 

The differential-screw mechanism consist* 
of a steel rod, F (connected with D), which has 
two screw threads at the lower end, one work-

This differential-screw focussing mechanism 
was found to work with great delicacy when

of manufacture compelled Messrs. Ross to 
adopt a simplified form, in which a direct- 
acting screw with a very fine thread is sub- 
stituted for the differential screw. Experience 
must decide the question of the durability of 
this later application of the fine screw ; the

motion is now so accurate that I am inclined to 
believe the difficult problem of designing a 
really efficient and convenient fine adjustment 
for the "Jackson" form of microscope has 
met with a solution&#8212; at least by approximation. 
Another solution of this problem has been

submitted to me recently by Messrs. Swift, and 
I must in fairness admit that they, too, have 
grappled with the difficulty with considerable 
success ; the system is applied in the next 
microscope we shall examine.

of movements combined in Mr. Wenham's 
design naturally arises. I am not prepared to 
say that any one of the movements is essentially 
useless in practical microscopy. I understand 
from Dr. Dallingcr, the President of the Royal 



Microscopical Society, that in some of his most 
difficult investigations in tracing the evolution 
of minute forms of life, no facilities hitherto 
devised for controlling the illumination, accord- 
ing to methods capable of being recorded and

repeated, have proved valueless ; and J believe 
he has tested this Radial Microscope by 
practice more thoroughly than any other 
microscopist. 

In the details of construction, several modi- 
fications of Zentmayer's plan of suspending 
the swinging tail-piece have been introduced 
by Messrs. Ross, to correct the tendency to 
flexure and general unsteadiness in the stage 
and substage so painfully evident inZentmayer's 
own construction ; and I must admit that my 
objections to the system of suspension have 
been correspondingly modified&#8212; but no further.

Swiff s Microscope (Wale's form).&#8212; In this 
microscope (Fig. 9 5,p. nn) Messrs. Swift have 
adopted a form of inclining limb devised by 
Mr. George Wale, of the United States, by 
which great stability in all positions of inclina- 
tion is secured. 

The limb is curved in the lower part in the 
form of a sector, and on either side a deep 
V-shaped groove is cut, by which it slides on 
corresponding projections at the upper ends 
of the base support ; the clamp-screw at the 
side serves to regulate the tension, or to fix 
the position. By this arrangement, the centre 
of gravity suffers very little displacement by 
the inclination of the limb, and the steadiness 
is well maintained. 

The curve of the limb allows complete rota- 



tion of the mechanical stage. The centering 
and rotating substage is furnished with rack 
movement, on which it is applied by a dove- 
tailed slide. The mirror, with gimbal, two 
arms, and rotating socket slides on the tail- 
piece, which is hinged to swing laterally on the 
end of the limb. 

To this instrument Messrs. Swift have 
applied a new arrangement of fine adjustment

which they have patented. The mechanism 
is shown in Fig. 94, where A a is the body- 
tube (the middle part cut away to show the 
action) connected with a chanoferred slide 
at either end at the back, fitted to move 
accurately and lightly on the front of the 
coarse adjustment slide, n H, of the usual " Jack- 
son " form, a spiral-spring above and at the 
back pressing it downwards. A long lever, D, 
is attached to the plate, B B, to pivot at E ; by 
the action of the milled-head, V, on the lower 
end, (i, of the le/er, the lifting stud, c, con- 
nected with the chamftrred slide behind the 
bod tube, B B, is raised very slowly through a 
focussing range of about 1-10 inch ; the

reverse action of the screw allows the spiral- 
spring above to press the slide downwards. 

By this very si.nple mechanism, the fine 
adjustment is applied on the front of the 
coarse adjustment, and acts on the whole 
body-tube, and not merely on the nose-piece, 
so that the magnification is not altered by 
change in the focal adjustment. It is obvious 
that the slowness of the motion is here con- 
trolled by three factors : (i) the length of the 
lever, n, (2) the distance of the lifting-stud, 
c, from the pivot or fulcrum, E, and the 
pitch of the sciew- thread on f. I am informed 
that Messrs. Swift anticipate being able to 
adapt this system of focussing to all their 
betterclass of instruments. My trials of this fine

immersion objective of the highe.it aperture 
hitherto constructed (1*5 N.A.) have led 
me to a decidedly favourable opinion of the 
mechanism. 

Swiff s Portable Microscope. &#8212; Of the many 
designs of portable microscopes, this little 
instrument (Fig. 96) is the most complete 
I have seen, and the workmanship (due, I 
believe, to Mr. Mansel Swift) is excellent. We 
have here a compound body with draw-tube 
fitting with inclining movement on a pillar 
with tripod base, four eye-pieces, four objectives 
(including 1-16 inch "immersion,") achro- 
matic condenser with diaphragms, stops, &amp;c, 
polarizer, analyzer, mirror with gimbal and 



sliding-rod, the whole fitting in a box of 
miniature dimensions. 

Seibert and Kraft's Fine Adjustment.&#8212; 
For small microscopes the form of fine adjust- 
ment shown in Fig. 97 has been much em- 
ployed in Germany for low-priced microscopes. 

The focussing screw, s, acts upon the funnel- 
shaped head of the pivot, m, the upper end of 
which acts in a similar manner upon //, the 
solid bar attached to the body-tube. The ring, 
r, which serves as a guide-piece, lies loose in 
the hollow pillar, and, as a rule, does not touch 
the pivot ; its function is merely to prevent the 
point of the pivot from slipping out of the

notch vaff. The cross-bars, * b (two on each 
side), are attached by screws to the hollow 
pillar, and the body-tube is held between the 
points of four screws near the front ends of the 
bars. The focussing motion is communicated 
to the solid bar, //, by the screw, s, acting 
against the pressure of the spiral spring shown 
above by dotted line, the friction being limited 
to the eight screws of the four cross-bars. The 
movement is similar to that of an ordinary 
parallel ruler with connecting bars, the hollow 
pillar being the stationary side. 

In later constructions the four bars have'been 
advantageously replaced by two broad plates.

Btus-h and Lamb's Fi&#187;i Adjustment.&#8212; 
This focussing system (Fig. 98) is probably 
the simplest that has ever been applied to the 
compound microscope, and seen&#8482; to have 
been suggested by the last we examined. 

The focussing screw, b, acts upon the angle- 
piece, t, which is connected by rack-work, / 
and^-, with the body-tube, h; e\% an angle-piece 
suspended on the pillar, c , by the two parallel 
springs, a a. The pressure of the screw, b, 
on e, depresses the body-tube, the springs, a a, 
allowing a motion of about i-io inch. By the 
reverse motion of the screw, the springs come 
back to the normal level as shown.

A defect in this system seems to have passed 
hitherto unnoticed. If a high power were in 
focus with the mechanism nearly in the 
position shown, a very slight pressure would 
cause the springs to bend, and thus the objec- 
tive might break the cover-glass. 

Messr.i. Beck, Rcis, and others appear to 
have adopted this system forsmall microscopes, 
and Messrs. Swift have reversed the move- 
ment (to avoid the danger I have noted) by 
converting the horizontal portion of e into a 
lever suspended on a fulcrum slightly to right 
of the upper a, by which the motion is made 
slower. 

Autde/fsXtnocu/ar Microscope.&#8212; Although 



personally I do not favour binocular micro- 
scopes, yet I think it will be of interest to 
briefly note upon the chief modern develop- 
ments in that direction. 

Prof. J. L. Ridde'.l, of New Orleans, was the 
original inventor of the binocular compound 
microscope with one objective. A copy of 
his original instrument was recently sent to 
England, which is shown in Fig. 99 (p. m 4 ). 
The arrangement of the binocular prisms is 
shown in section in Fig. ioo (p. 1115). 

The pencil of rays emerging from the ob- 
jective, /, is divided in two, each half passing 
respectively into the right and left prisms ; the 
path of the rays is a, b, c, d, the object is at o. 
To facilitate the perfect coalescence of the 
images in the field of view for every width of 
eyes, Professor Riddell provided (i) a means 
of regulating the inclination of the prisms by 
mounting them in hinged frames, so that, 
while their lower terminal edges remain 
always in parallel contact, the inclination of 
the internal reflecting surfaces can be varied 
by the action of a milled head in front of the 
prism box; (2) the lower ends of the binocular 
tubes are connected by travelling sockets, 
moving on one and the same axis, on which 
are cut corresponding right and left-handed 
screws, so that the width of the tubes may 
correspond with that of the prisms ; and (3) 
the upper ends of the tubes are connected by 
racks, one acting above and the other below 
the same pinion, so that right and left-handed 
movements are communicated by turning the 
pinion. 

Professor Riddell found that, in many cases, 
it was advantageous to employ two small con- 
cave mirrors rather than one large mirror, so 
as to equalise the illumination in both fields. 

To obviate the inconvenience of using the 
instrument always in the vertical position, 
small right-angled prisms are so mounted in 
brass caps as to be slipped at pleasure over 
the eye pieces. The combination of the bino- 
cular prisms with the eye-piece prisms inverts 
the image in both planes, so that the move- 
ment upon the stage is seen through the in- 
strument without inversion. 

This system of binocular seems to have 
excited much curiosity at the date of its 
first publication in England (1854), and Mr. 
Wenham, and Messrs. Nachet, of Paris, were 
soon in the field with a number of binocular 
arrangements. One of the devices of the 
latter firm was converted into a binocular 
erecting eye-piece for the microscope and 
telescope by Tolles, of Boston, and for mode-

Brucke proposed to use achromatic doublets 
in combination with a concave eye - lens 
for moderate magnifications, where simple 
lenses or ordinary doublets or triplets had pre- 
viously been employed. Fig. ,02 shows the form 
issued by Nachet, in which the eye-lens is 
mounted in a draw-tube, so that different 
magnificat.ons can be obtained ; the mounting 
&gt;s applicable to any form of simple microscope 
or lens-carrier. Zeiss has also worked out 
excellent combinations of this form in fixed 
settings, and supplies a small stand designed 
expressly for them. Our opticians appear to 
have wholly neglected this most useful little 
dissecting microscope.

settles down into stillness&#8212; provided one docs 
not breathe upon it. 

We have now passed in rapid review some of 
the best types of microscopes designed since 
the first application of achromatism. The 
number might he greatly increased, had we 
time and space, for in addition to the more 
important type-models I have described, every 
optician I have mentioned (and many others I 
have not mentioned) has brought out forms of 
less and less complete design, to meet the

demands of students and others to whom 
economy of outlay was almost the first con- 
sideration. The designs of these less complete 
instruments are of inferior interest, because we 
know that the principal criterion by which they 
are to be estimated is the expense. As a rule, 
however, those opticians who have devised and 
made the best class of microscopes, have also 
devised and made the most serviceable forms 
of lower class. 

Then, again, numerous designs have been 
produced for special purposes. We have 
microscopes for the observation of chemical 
processes and the fusion of metals, &amp;c, where 
the instrument has to be protected from the 



action of acids, gases, heat. &amp;c. Penological 
microscopes, where polarisin j and goniometri- 
cal appliances are chiefly embodied (of these I 
remark, in passing, that M. Nachet has made 
a specialty, and his instruments are probably 
the most complete of the kind). Then we have 
microscopes for recording the growth of plants ; 
forviewing objects at the bottom of an aquarium, 
by means of an aquatic nose-piece; for ob- 
serving the circulation of the blood in the 
frcenum of the tongue, &amp;c. ; for counting the 
threads of silk, wool, linen, &amp;c. ; for measuring 
lengths to an accuracy of i- 100,000 inch or 
higher ; for viewing the walls of the stomach 
and other internal parts of the body by means 
of an electric light ; for class demonstrations ; 
for field work ; for examining large specimens 
of minerals, &amp;c, for which Marten's Ball- 
jointed microscope was specially designed, 
with ball-and-socket movements to the body- 
tube carriers ; and we have several instru- 
ments that were designed expressly to compete 
for the medals offered by the Society of Arts, 
in 1855, for School Microscopes and Students' 
Microscopes. The best known models for 
these and many other purposes are exhibited 
here, and with due time at my disposal we 
might pass them all in review. 

With reference to accessory apparatus 
originated or improved in conjunction with 
the achromatic microscope, I may note that 
the Huyghenian and Ramsden forms of eye- 
pieces, as applied to the telescope [3* the 
former slightly modified), have come into 
use ; that Orthoscopic or Aplanatic eye- 
pieces, and " Holosteric " or solid cyc-picccs, 
have been occasionally applied ; partially 
achromatised (Kellner), and in some cases 
wholly achromatised (Schroeder) eye-pieces 
have been tried, but with by no means the 
amount of advance in optical power that was 
expected by Lalande, Brewster, and others. 
Amplifiers have been tried, beginning with 
Selligue ; and latterly they have been achro- 
matised by Tolles and Zeiss specially for 
photo-micrography. 

The greatest improvement amongst the dif- 
ferent kinds of apparatus contrived for illu- 
mination has been the achromatic condenser 
as made by Powell and Lealand, which has a 
series of stops and graduated diaphragms for 
regulating the light. Other opticians have 
contrived more or less elaborated forms of 
sub-stage condenser, in some cases combining 
a number of appliances in one piece of appa- 
ratus ; my impression is that, in many of them, 
too much is attempted, and hence essential

paint* are somewhat neglected. More recently, 
i'owell and Lealand have been working ou l 
an achromatic condenser to correspond as 
nearly as possible with the highest apertures 
of our objectives ; the successful production 
of this apparatus is waited for with much 
interest by Dr. Dallinger and others, includ- 
ing myself. 

J hen we have had many devices for oblique 
illumination, such as Amici's prism, and Du- 
lardir/s prism, variously applied ; the " Ver- 
tical Illuminator," in which the objective is 
made to act as a condenser to the object ; 
Kcid's " Kettle Drum ; " Woodward's Prism : 
the Hemispherical Lens ; Wenham's Semi- 
disc ; the "Diatomoscope;" double-prisms; 
mirrors arranged to rack close to the base of 
the slide ; silvered glass slips to place beneath 
the slide to be illuminated from above ; prisms 
cemented on the face of the slide, so as to 
transmit rays to be totally reflected from the 
internal surface of the base of the slide ; 
Catoptric and Cata-dioptric Illuminators of 
almost impossible complexityof action ; an Im- 
mersion Sta^e Illuminator; a multiple plane- 
faced prism and lens ; a semi-cylinder Illumin- 
ator, and a host of others, the great majority of 
which have had their day, and arc now rapidly 
being forgotten. 

For dark-ground illumination we have had 
Spot lenses, Amici's Inverted Cone, Shadbolt's 
Annular and Sphaercvannular Condensers, 
Wenham's Parabolic Reflecting Mirror, the 
Wenham-Shadbolt Paraboloid, Wenham's Im- 
mersion Paraboloid, Wenham's Reflex Illumi- 
nator, and a few other similar contrivances, of 
which the Spot-lenses and the Wenham-Shad- 
bolt Paraboloid still survive. For " opaque " 
illumination we have the Lieberkuhn, the 
Selligue Prism, the Parabolic Side Reflector, 
and a few minor variations of little importance. 
Special devices have been contrived to furnish 
monochromatic light of any primary colour. 

Of diaphragms we have had circular, square, 
oblong, triangular, indeed almost every imagin- 
able shape, tried singly or in series, sometimes 
combined by means of superposed slides or by 
rotating plates. In one or two non-achromatic 
Immersion Illuminators we have had a small 
circular diaphragm made to move from the 
axis to the margin of a combination of lenses 
of high aperture. Rotating calotte dia- 
phragms have been adapted by Zeiss 
and Swift. We have also iris-diaphragms, 
&lt; ombined with condensers or alone, or again 
used at the nose-piece to reduce apertures. I 
Jon't think they have yet been applied to the j 



eyepiece to cut down the field, but this will 
come, as an " important " modification, doubt- 
less, of other and better methods. 

Then we have double, triple, quadruple, and 
sextuple nose-pieces, first sliding, then rota- 
ting, some set at an angle, then curved, then 
mounted on a calotte, and, for lightness, the 
best have been made of aluminium. Thes.- 
devices should not be employed on high-class 
microscopes focussing by the nose-piece, as 
they are very apt to strain the sensitive 
mechanism. 

Of changing nose-pieces, we have, first. 
Chevalier's double stud projecting from a ring! 
slipping into corresponding slots in the face of 
the socket, and held by a slight rotation ; then 
the Geneva Optical and Physical Company's 
changing nose-pie~e, where the objectives 
have rings with shallow flanges slipping under 
a spring catch&#8212; a method also adopted by M. 
Nachet, and by M. Bertrand ; then we have 
Mr. Nelson's arrangement, where three short 
segments of tn&#171;* internal thread of the nose- 
piece are cut away, and corresponding seg- 
ments are removed from the screw-threads of 
the objectives, so that they may be pushed in. 
the nose piece, and slightly turned, which 
plan has brought upon us a mass of modifica- 
tions, suggestive that we should pass the 
remainder of our natural lives in mastering 
their construction and use&#8212; many of them more 
troublesome to use than the screw-systtm they 
are intended to supersede. 

We have more than twenty different arrange- 
ments for carrying bull's-eye condensers, as 
many lamps of special design for use with the 
microscope, of which Dr. Dallinger's, with its 
adjustable screens, &amp;c, is designed for the 
" fine art " of microscopy ; while Mr. Nelson's 
is less complex, but still thoroughly practical. 
Then we have screw stage-micrometers, and 
simple ruled stage-micrometers, and others of 
various designs, to measure blood corpuscles- 
with or without the aid of photography ; screw 
eye-piece micrometers of both the Huyghenian 
and Ramsden forms, to be carried preferably 
on a separate stand, and not in the body-tube, 
where extreme accuracy is rt quired, as sug- 
gested by Mr. Nelson&#8212; in some cases, to avoid 
errors due to unequal magnification of the 
centre and the margin of the eye-lens, a lateral 
motion has been added to the eye-lens, so that 
the measurements are always determined by 
the image seen in the axis only; Jackson's 
eye-piece micrometer (a simple and practical 
device); Hartmack's eye-pier* micrometer, 
with oblique scale; eye-pieces with crossed

Teadily estimating comparative dimensions, 
and others with fine ruled squares of known 
dimensions, which were generally applied by 
Andrew Ros-j and Hugh Powell to the Rams- 
den eye-piece, at the focus of the combination. 

We have Camera: Lucidx, such as Wollaston' s, 
dividing the pupil of the eye ; Soemmering's 
steel disc, conveying the image from the micro- 
scope to the centre of the pupil, the outer zone 
of the eye viewing the pencil and paper directly ; 
Beale's neutral tint reflector ; many forms 
devised by Nachet, the best of which has a 
film of gold on the final reflecting surface 
through which the microscope image is Men 
tinged with green colour due to the gold ; 
Zeiss's or Abbe's, which are similar in action 
to Nachet's ; Nobert's, Chevalier's, Beck's, 
and the best of all that 1 have tried&#8212; Schroeder' s, 
which is a modification of the principle utilised 
in Wenham's high-power binocular prism. 

We have frog plates ; animalcule cages or 
"" live " boxes ; compressoria ; vivisection troughs 
for showing the circulation of the blood in the 
lung of the frog ; hot stages and reservoirs 
with multitudinous devices for maintaining an 
even temperature ; stages with electrical ap- 
pliances for viewing minute vacuum tubes, &amp;c. ; 
safety stages of several designs, the earliest 
(intended as such) probably by Powell, which 
is seen on a large microscope he made for 
Stonyhurst College in 1842, and the simplest 
form is that recently devised by Prof. Charles 
Stewart, Curator of the College of Surgeons, 
in which the slide is held by two india-rubber 
bands stretched across a light wood frame, 
useful for class demonstrations. And we have 
polarisers and analysers of various designs ; 
wini' of the former give a much larger field 
than NicoPs prism, and permit the combina- 
tion with a condenser, as in Hartnack's form ; 
of the latter, some rotate at the nose-piece in 
the body-tube, or, again, over theeye-piece com- 
bination with a graduated goniometrical disc 
and pointer, as in Hartnack's. Double-image 
prisms have been devised by Prazmowski and 
by Abbe. For carrying selenites we have 
many systems of convenient rotation ; and 
in one instance we have clock-work applied to 
keep the rotation of one or more plates going, 
to amuse the ladies when we exhibit sections 
of the " North Pole," Sec, at soirits 

Of curiosities among achromatic micro-

capable of knocking me down if I were to release

Society of Arts awarded him a medal. The 
original model of the Oberhaeuser Dissecting 
Microscope, with a telescopic erecting eye- 
piece applied. The original model of Amici's 
Horizontal Dioptric Microscope. The working 
microscope by Amici that formerly belonged 
to the distinguished Italian, Professor Alessan- 
drini, of Bologna. Wenham's original Bin- 
ocular Microscope. A copy of Riddell's 
original Binocular Microscope. Then we have 
" Jumbo," the largest microscope known ; and 
the " Midget," the smallest working model 
known ; and a piettily-made " drum " micro- 
scope, by Alfred Nachet as a lad ; and 
three binocular microscopes, consisting of 
achromatic objectives sawn through to form 
binoculars&#8212; a sort of quintessence of absurdity 
for modem binoculars. Then we have 
some of Tully's early objectives ; some of 
Chevalier's ; Amici's, including early oil- 
immersions, and a ruby-fronted immersion ; 
Wenham's, with his first binocular prism 
applied almost in contact with lite posterior 
combination; the famous 1-6 inch immersion 
of Tolles, about which part of the aperture 
controversy turned; and a 1-4 inch, also by 
Tolles, with a tiny prism behind the (ront lens 
for projecting light upon opaque objects 
through the front lens. 

You will naturally expect me to say some- 
thing of the progress that has been made in 
the construction of objectives. 

The Selligue objectives I have examined 
were by no means good, from our present 
stand-point of excellence ; those of Chevalier 
were unquestionably better ; and those of 
Tully better still. The best I have seen of 
Tully's were small doublet fronts with larger 
triplets above. The earliest of Oberhaeuser's 
were apparently copied from Chevalier's. It 
is said that Lister's discovery of aplanatic foci 
led immediately to great improvement in ob- 
jectives ; in proof of this, however, I have 
only met vague assertive evidence. The 
Knglish optician who did more than all thi 
others together to improve objectives was the 
late Hugh Powell, and he repeatedly affirmed 
to me that every advance he himself had made, 
since the days of Tully's first efforts, had 
been arrived at by sheer experiment, without 
a single hint of any value from any theorist 
whatsoever. It is also certain that Oberhaeuser, 
Hartnack, Nachet, senior, knew nothing of 
Lister's investigations, and yet, as late as i36;,

objectives made by them were only slightly 
inferior to Powell's, and wee quite on a par 
with objectives of any other English maker. 
Whence 1 infer that Lister's influence has 
been much exaggerated. 

By sheer experiment it appears to me that 
the great bulk (if not the whole) of the imptove- 
ment in England was made down to 1868, when 
Powell undertook the experiment with the 
immersion system, in consequence of my show- 
ing him certain immersion objectives by 
Hartnack. In Paris, the frequent visits of 
Amici from 1824 onwards kept certain of the 
opticians au courant of his incessant experi- 
ments, and I have been informed, on reliable 
authority, that the first immersion lenses he 
made (about 1840) were designed to be used 
with certain oils which were regarded as 
practically equal to glass in refraction, thus 
really constructing homogeneous-immersion 
objectives, though without any conception of 
the possibility of apertures greater than would 
correspond to the maximum air apertures. 
Exception was taken by the amateurs of that 
day to the use of oil, on the ground that their 
slides were injured by it, and hence Amici 
gave up the oil-immersion system and adopted 
water as the immersion fluid. In 1855, he 
showed a number of water-immersion ob- 
jectives in Paris, and Nachet. senior, and 
Hartnack worked out some on the same 
type. In 1862, Prazmowski joined Hartnack, 
and the production of immersion objectives 
made great progress, thanks to Prazmowski's 
combination of theory and practice, so that, at 
the Exhibition of 1867, the objectives exhibited 
by Hartnack were notably in advance of 
those of his rivals. Erom 1867, until quite 
recently, the Paris opticians made but very slow 
progress with their immersion objectives. In 
England, on the contrary, no sooner had Powell 
and Lealand started with the immersion system, 
than their objectives immediately became the 
best in the field. Wales, in America, and 
Spencer turned out high-class immersion ob- 
jectives as early as 1869-70, and then Tolles 
engaged upon them with more concentration 
of effort (for previously he had only made them 
at intervals), and soon produced "optical 
curiosities" in which he claimed (18723) to 
have increased the apertures beyend the maxi- 
mum possible with dry objectives. Meanwhile, 
Zeiss had been working at immersion objec- 
tives, and in his catalogue of 1874 he distinctly 
claimed apertures of " 104 to 108 in a film of 
water, whereas such an angle of even about 96 
would correspond to an angle ol 1S0 in air." 



A great controversy took place between 
Tolles and Wenham on the apeiture question, 
on which I will not enter except so far as to 
state that, in support of his claims, Tolles pub- 
lished, or caused to be published on his behaK, 
certain computations relating to the apertures 
of his immersion objectives. During this con- 
troversy, Tolles produced a number of objective s 
having an extra front lens, which were of 
special excellence. Amongst them was a 
certain 1-6 inch that he made for Mr. Frank- 
Crisp, and the aperture of which was the sub- 
ject of endless published letters, &amp;c. 

In 1878 Zeiss produced, under the instruc- 
tions of Dr. Abbe, oil immersion-objectives, 
which were afterwards termed "homo- 
geneous" immersion, and was immediately 
followed in England and America by the 
best opticians. When Zeiss's oil immer- 
sions were first issued, Dr. Abbe stated that 
the idea of the system had been suggested 
to him by Mr. J. W. Stephenson, the 
Treasurer of the Royal Microscopical Society. 
Of course, I cannot for a moment dispute Dr. 
Abbe's statement as to the origin of the idea 
so far as he was concerned ; but his testimony 
related only to the communications as between 
Mr. Stephenson and himself, leaving wholly 
untouched the question of Mr. Stephenson's 
originality. In my opinion the origin of the 
homogeneous-immersion formula is largely 
due to Mr. R. B. Tolles, and I think this can 
be substantiated by the now generally admitted 
criterion&#8212; the priority of publication. 

In Vol. X. (1874) of the "Monthly Micro- 
scopical Journal," pp. 124-5, Mr. R. Keith 
published the elements furnished by Mr. 
Tolles, from which he had computed the aper- 
ture of a certain 1-10 inch objective, about 
which a part of the aperture controversy had 
turned. Photographs of the computation, in 
extenso, were forwarded to the editor of the 
journal and to me, for distribution among 
those interested in the subject ; with reference 
to the copies of the computation sent to the 
editor of the journal, a note was appended to 
Mr. Keith's paper stating that they were to be 
obtained by communicating with the editor. 

That computation distinctly traced the rays 
of light from the posterior focus to the radiant 
at the front of the objective, and the immersion 
medium connecting the front lens with the 
radiant was assi med to be fluid balsam, of the 
same refractive index as the substance of the 
front lens, and consequently was homogeneous 
with it. Clearly this was a published formula 
for homogeneous-immersion. That the idea

of the influence of more highly refractive 
medium was distinctly in the minds of Mr. 
To"es and hie friends, was proved incontest- 
ably by the statement of Dr. J. J. Woodward, 
in a paper accompanying that of Mr. Keith, 
as follows : &#8212; 

" Mr. Keith farther slates that he has computed 
the spherical aberration of the combination, adjusted 
as above [i.e., at the position of the correction- 
ailjustn::nt (or maximum aperture], and finds it 
practically nil. This being the case, the objective 
ought to perform well when adjusted to the point of 
maximum apertuie, if balsam be used as the immer- 
sion fluid in lieu of water Accordingly, in 

company with Mr. Keith, I tested the objective in 
this way on Grammatophora subtiHsrima by lamp- 
light, and we both thought the definition unmis- 
takably better than with water immersion." ("Month. 
Mkr. Journ.," loc. cit., p. 127). 

It should be distinctly held in view that the 
publication of Mr. Tolles's formula took place 
in 1874, and from that formula any other com- 
petent optician might have constructed similar 
objectives. I think the formula could not be 
raoro accurately designated than by the title 
" homogeneous-immersion formula," though 
that expression was not employed till some 
seven years later. 

The Zeiss oil-immersion objectives, made 
to a formula of Dr. Abbe, which he stated 
was the outcome of a suggestion by Mr. 
Stephenson, were not issued till 1878, and the 
formula has not yet been published. 

If priority of publication of the formula on 
which homogeneous-immersion lenses could 
be produced carries with it the title of 
inventor, then Mr. R. B. Tolles stands alone 
as the inventor ; but he not only published 
the formula, he constructed objectives on it. 
It would not do to say that Mr. Stephenson's 
suggestion was made with a view to obtaining 
apertures greater than correspond to the maxi- 
mum for dry objectives. That might be quite 
true of Mr. Stephenson in 1878; but it was 
quite as certainly true of Mr. Tolles in 
1874, at a date when Mr. Stephenson denied 
the possibility of any such apertures. 

I have stated the claims of the late R. B. 
Tolles as against those of Mr. Stephenson 
under a consciousness of grave responsibility. 
The future of the microscope will probably be 
so much involved in the successful develop- 
ment of the homogeneous-immersion formula-, 
that the merits of the originators of the system 
will have more and more substantial recog- 
nition. Amici led the way, as I have said, 



by the application of the immersion system to 
modern achromatic compound microscopes. 
He made objectives for use with oil-immer- 
sion and then with water-immersion, but, 
so far as I know, Amici merely aimed at 
getting more and more perfect correction of 
the aberrations., without any definite con- 
ception of the possible extension of apertures 
beyond those of dry objectives. The merit of 
Tolles was that he first published a formula 
by which the possible attainment of such 
apertures was demonstrated theoictically, and 
he supported his case by the practical con- 
struction of such objectives. His formula 
was strictly for homogeneous-immersion, and 
his 1 -10 inch objective, by the testimony 
of Dr. Woodward and Mr. Keith, con- 
structed on that formula, gave its best results 
when used with homogeneous-immersion. It 
would be strange, indeed, if, when the history 
of the evolution of the homogeneous-immersion 
system comes to be written definitely, the 
whole credit of its invention should be given 
to Mr. Stephenson, in the face of the fact, to 
which I have already adverted, that at the 
date of the publication of Tolles's formula, Mr. 
Stephenson denied the validity of that formula 
by denying the possibility of the existence of 
the aperture computed, a denial which he 
appears to have persisted in until about the date 
of the publication, in English, of Dr. Abbe's 
admission that such apertures were possible. 
Mr. Stephenson's conversion from the wrong to 
the right side of the controversy was, of 
course, a valuable factor in support of the 
position of Tolles, whether it coincided accu- 
rately with Dr. Abbe's admission of the validity 
of Tolles's argument or not. 

In conclusion, permit me to say that no ex- 
pressions that I can employ will adequately 
convey my appreciation of the services ren- 
dered by Dr. E. Abbe, of Jena University, 
by the publication of his researches on the 
"Theory of Microscopical Vision." Dr. 
Abbe has revolutionised the old empirical 
views as to the value of high apertures, 
demonstrating that high amplifications, unless 
accompanied by proportionately high aper- 
tures, produce necessarily untrue images of 
minute structure. He has also introduced a 
practically perfect system of estimating 
apertures, known as the " Numerical aperture 
notation," by which not only can an accurate 
comparison be made of the relative apertures 
of any series of objectives, whether dry or 
immersion, hut their resolving power under 
the various conditions of the kind of light em-

Dr. Abbe's services in connection with the 
practical production of objectives on tht homo- 
geneous-immersion system by Mr. Zeiss must 
also be recognised emphatically. It is known, 
too, that he has long been engaged on a 
problem of the highest importance for the 
progress of all optical instruments&#8212; the pro- 
duction of new kinds of glass, by which he 
anticipates greatly reducing the secondary 
spectra. Within a few days only we have had 
news of a most promising character regarding 
h's success. I need hardly say that if this 
problem reaches a practical solution, micro- 
scopy will have a new start. 

When I go back in memory to the condition 
of the microscope in my early days, and pass 
in review the progress I have witnessed in the 
construction of the instrument both optically 
and mechanically, in view of the great strides 
made in my time and of the possible improve- 
ment foreshadowed by Dr. Abbe's latest 
researches in the combinations of new kinds of 
glass, I am led most strongly to the conclusion 
that microscopy has before it the prospect of a 
glorious future.

ELEMENTARY LECTURES. 

ELECTRICITY. 

By Professor George Forbes. 

Lecture VI- Delivered May and, 1886. 
Practical Applications of Electricity. 

At the conclusion of my last lecture I stated 
that I proposed to make an alteration in the 
programme. I had originally intended that 
my last lecture should have been upon the 
subject of electrical measurement, showing 
how a system of electrical units has been 
evolved, each one dependent upon the other. 
I his would have been a very interesting field, 
and is a most important matter, and I should 
have been glad to include it in the course of 
lecti-.-es; but the course was started with a 
special object in view, that of passing in review 
IB the fundamental principles and laws of elec- 
tricity which regulate these numerous applica- 
tions which we meet with every day, and to enable 
those who arc not practical electricians to bo 



able to understand what they meet with in the 
course of their daily life, in the numerous* 
applications of electricity. For this reason I 
announced last week that I intended to change 
the subject of this lecture, and to review in a 
sketchy manner some of the more important 
practical applications of those general laws, 
principles, and discoveries which we have been 
examining for the last five lectures, and to 
show how these things are applied in actual 
practice. To-day I shall deal with some of the 
more important applications. 

Among these applications I think you will 
all agree with me that the most important at 
the present time is the great facility which 
we have acquired of creating almost unlimited 
quantities of electricity by means of the transfor- 
mation from mechanical power into electricity. 
This is the result of the dynamo machine. After 
that I propose to say something about another 
application, which has had a great deal to do 
with the development of civilisation in its pre- 
sent form, and that is the invention of the 
electric telegraph. And, in conclusion, I pro- 
pose to speak of the still later invention, but 
one which has attained such a vast application 
in the short period of its existence, namely, 
the telephone. 

In the development of invention applied to 
the progress of civilisation, there are two 
essentially different parts to be carried out. 
First, there is the grand field of discovery, and 
in this field of discovery in electrical science 
no name stands higher than that of our 
celebrated countryman, Faraday, whose name 
has been so often mentioned in these lectures. 
And, secondly, there is the work of the practical 
inventor, who realises the tools which have 
been put into his hand by the philosopher, 
and who applies these tools to evolve prac- 
tical ideas, and turn out inventions which 
assist the progress of civilisation. I am 
first going to speak to you about the manner 
of construction of the dynamo machine, and 
all that I can hope, in this sketchy review of 
the subject, is to be able to tell you enough 
about it so that, when you see a dynamo 
machine running, you ma&gt; be able to appreciate 
theobject and purpose of the several partsof that 
machine, and be able to judge to some extent 
how far these different parts seem to be suit- 
able to fulfil their offices. 

In my last lecture, I showed you the action 
of this little machine which is due to Faraday, 
consisting of a coil of wire which is capable 
of rotation round one of its diameters. In 
doing so, it cuts the earth's lines of force- that

CANTOR LECTURES. 
THK MODERN MICROSCOPK. 

Rv John Mayai.i., J in. 

Lecture I. &#8212; Delivered February, 2-, iSSS. 

Before pioceeding with the subject-proper 
I have engaged to treat of in these lectures, I 
think it will be il profios that I should ask 
your attention to sundry points of historical 
interest, which will serve partly to supple- 

ent and partly to correct certain data and 
criticisms made thereon in my previous 
Cantor Lectures on the Microscope.* The 
matters I wish to refer to in this connection 
are generally such as have come to my notice 
within the last two years only, and this I trust 
will be considered a sufficient reason for 
dweffing upon them now. 

I formerly stated that there was consider- 
able difficulty in fixing the precise origin of 
the microscope, both as regards the actual 
date, and as to the particular form of the con- 
struction of the earliest models, but that the 
date was probably within the two decades 
comprised between 1590 and 1610. 

If, however, we may consider the simple 
hand-magnifier as a microscope&#8212; and there 
is, I think, a general concurrence of opinion 
that we are entitled to do so &#8212; then I am able 
to establish the existence of microscopes in 
the early years of the 16th century by graphic 
evidence of a specially interesting kind, evi- 
dence that appears to have wholly escaped 
the notice of writers on the microscope 
hitherto. I refer to the portrait of Pope 
Leo X., painted by Raphael between 13 1., 



Sec Journal, \"! xxxiv. \iii , pp. 
lsjl-100, iojt-ioi:, and 1005-mt. 



;.;,-, IC--T-I Jit- 



and 1520, which is in the Palazzo Pitti, 
Florence, and in which the Pope is shown 
holding a hand-magnifier, evidently intended 
for the examination of miniatures, &amp;c, in an 
open volume upon the table. Fig. 1 (p. 1 150) 
is reproduced from an engraving of this portrait. 

As it is hardly to be supposed that this 
hand-magnifier was the first ever constructed, 
we may infer with some probabilit&gt; that simple 
microscopes of this form may have been 
known in the 15th century, or even earlier. 
The construction of such an instrument would 
necessarily acquaint the optician with the 
dependence of the magnifying power on the 
curvatures of the lens surfaces, which would 
assuredly lead to the production of lenses of 
different power for various purposes ; so that 
the evolution of the microscope may have 
been practically contemporaneous with the 
construction of the earliest spectacles &#8212; may, 
in fact, have been bmught about through the 
experimental efforts to produce convex spec- 
tacle glasses suitable for different sights. 

With this anterior evidence before us, de- 
monstrating the existence of hand magnifiers 
so early, we need no longer perplex ourselves 
with endeavouring to interpret the vague pas- 
sages in Fracastoro's " Homocentrica " which 
certain writers' have cited as evidence that he 
must have known the use of lenses combined 
as in telescopes, whilst others* think the 
matter doubtful. 

Galileo's Microscopes. &#8212; The very early con- 
nection of Galileo's name with the evolution 
of the microscope is a fact of so much historical

t In I &gt;rinkwatcr's " I.ifc of Galileo " Penny Cyclopxdia), 
it is stated that Fracastoro's "expressions, though they seem 
to refer to a. rtual experiment, yet fall short ol the meaning 
with which it has been attempted to invest them." Fracas- 
toro's knowledge of the employment of lenses is bated on 
the following passage, and another more vague, from nil 
"Homocentrica," sec. ii., cap. S p. li of the original 
edition, Venctiis, 153H, 4to , "per duo specilla ocularia ii

p-opinijuiora uidebit omnia," which Drinkwater translates 
" if anyone looks through two eyeglasses, one placed upon 
the cthet, be will see everything much larger and nearer." 
Drinkwater adds : " It should seem that this passage (as 
I&gt;c!ambre has already remarked) rathor refers to the close 
application of one glass upon another, and it may fairly bo 
doubted whether anything analogous to the composition of 
jhe telescope was in the writer's tbairfhts." Arago, in his

I was enabled to secure photographs' of these 
microscopes, which are here reproduced in

When I was permitted to examine these 
instruments some two years ago, and again 
about a year ago, I could not evade the 
suspicion that, if the tradition were critically 
examined, it might be extremely difficult, if 
not impossible, to track them to the days of 
Galileo. The construction of these two micro- 
scopes seemed to me so far superior to that of 
most of the optical instruments made within 
20 or ,p years of the death of Galileo (1642), 
including Galileo's own telescope, that I could 
not avoid being sceptical as to their alleged 
origin. I note also the great similarity of 
design between these microscopes and that of

has escaped the attention of writers on the 
microscope hitherto, I here give a photo- 
oncograph of it (Fig. 5 J, which will also serve 
to illustrate what was then considered the 
proper mode of employing it. 

In the matter of construction the advantage 
is clearly with the "Galileo" microscopes;

its similarity to a microscope in the Conserva- 
toire des Arts et Metiers, Paris, bearing the 
inscription, "Giuseppe Campani, in Roma, 
1673," I should confidently assign to Campani. 
The "Galileo" microscopes clearly represent 
a higher grade of mechanical design and con- 
struction. 

Schott's Microscopes.&#8212; \ formerly repro- 
duced certain curious figures of microscopes 
from Gaspar Schott's " Magia Universalis " 
(1657), expressing myself against the pro- 
bability of their having ever been constructed as 
shown. A suggestion has been made by Mr. 
Frank Crisp, Secretary of the Royal Micro- 
scopical Society, by which the anomalous 
appearance of the instruments may be ex- 
plained, and as the suggestion appears to me 
highly probable, 1 venture to bring it to your 



notice. To render the matter readily intelli- 
gible I reproduce the figures again. (Figs. 
7, 8, and 9, p. 1154.) 

It is obvious that we estimate the size of the 
n-icroscopes by comparison with the size of the 
observer figured with them. Mr. Crisp sug- 
gests, then, ''.iat the draughtsman, knowing 
probably nothing of the subject, instead of 
figuring an eye only directed to the instruments, 
represented the fuli-length figure of the ob- 
server, whence we estimate the microscopes to 
be of prodigious size. This explanation is 
supported by a comparison with Figs. 10, 11, 
and 12, (p. 1 154) from Traber's "Nervus Opti- 
cus" (Vienn.-n Austria:, 1675, fol., PI. IV.), in 
which references are made to Schott's work. 

This explanation seems to me the more 
acceptable from the fact that in describing 
Divini's microscope (Fig. 9), Schott states that 
it had a tripod support &#8212; " super triptdalc 
fulcrum" &#8212; which his draughtsman has con- 
verted into the fanciful picture of an enormous 
cylindrical tube, with the observer standing on 
a sort of embankment to look into it ; whereas 
Traber's figure (my Fig. 12) plainly shows the 
support, and the instrument appears of reason- 
able dimensions. Moreover, Schott distinctly 
states that Fig. 13, p. 1155 (Descartes' lens) 
was taken from Kircher's "Ars Magna Lucis 
ct Umbra-" (Romae, 1646, fol.), and on refer- 
ence to that work we find an eye only directed 
to the lens (see my Fig. 14, p. 115J. repro- 
duced from Kircher's work); and we note, 
further, that the insect figured by Kircher on 
the end of a pointed [rod was converted by 
Schott's draughtsman into a candle flame ! 

Hooke's Microscope.&#8212; The application of 
the field-lens to the eye-lens in compound 
mieroscopes (described by Hooke in his 
" Micrographia," 1665) appeared to me the 
most important item of Hooke's improvements 
in microscopes; but further research has con- 
vinced me that he was preceded by Monconys 
in this application. 

Moncony's Microscope.&#8212; In the "Journal 
des Voyages de Monsieur dc Monconys" 
(Lyon, 1665, 4to, ri re partie, p. 128) we find a 
description of his microscope, which I here 
give in translation : &#8212;

I: is evident that a compound microscope 
leaving a field-lens could be constructed fr&lt; m 
these data. Monconys died in i'^64, and from 
.1 note on p. 117 '.' c. est.) it appears that he 
had the instn:mcnt made, in i&#171; ' i, by tli 
&#8226;&#8226; son-in-law of Viseliusj." 

In -upport of Monconys* a claim to have first 
i vised a micro$&lt; -pe with a fi&lt; Id-lens, I may 
&#9632; &#9632; the testimony of Honorato Fabri, who 
states in his "Synopsis Optica" (I.ugdunt, 
&#9632;&#9632;-, (to.), p. 153, that the tir^t instrument 
ki -.vn to him of this construction was made 
it A gsburg to the design of Monconys. 

Wherever Monconys travelled he was alert 
in -arching for microscopes and telescopes. 
h visiting Italy he met Toricelli, Ivircher, 
I&gt;i&#171;ini, and others connected ^.:h scientifii 
pursuits, and coming to England in May, 
: ;. he mentions [.\&gt;c. C.t., - &#8226; /&#9632;'''&#9632;' &#9632; 
p. u-] that he visited " Riues en I. mgenker" 
[Reeves, of Long-acre], " who mikes ex-

later he railed again, and was shown a 
*&gt;lantcrne: . : " lark-lantern =r " magic-

Having Jisposci! of the more imp 

ing to the early history of the micro- 
: t" which I wished to direct your 
attention, 1 come to the distinctly modern 
microscojn 1 premise that it would pro- 

bably be fiund a convenient arrangement to 
divide microscopi s into two great classes, 
An, unt and Modern; the former term to in- 
1 lude all microscopes made anterior to the 
general introduction of achromatism (l^-p. 
whilst the latter term would designate all 
inicrosi opes 1 onstructi d sub icquently. 

The application of achromatism to the 
microscope produced great changes in the 
Iruction of the instrument. The increase 
of the apertures of tie- objectives, involving, as 
1! did, the decrease of the depth of the focal 
plane, immediately betrayed many imperfec- 
ta its in the design and construction of the 
sin:,' arrangements that had previously 
Ii en either unnoticed or regarded as untm- 
int. 

: rly gave a figure of the oar!, est form 
omatie microscope made in t'ranct &#8212; 
Selligue's. I am now able to place before you 
one of the earliest known Knglish models - 
Tullcy's(l ; ig. i*, p. 115N). The former had n ) 
very distinctive claims to originality of design, 
but was only slightly mo Iiflcd from what was 
it that period one of th &#9632; best Knglish mii ro- 
; made by Adams, or Jones, or DoIIond. 
In the instruments I have seen bearing 
Selligue's name, the objectives (and possibly 
[he oculars; were made by Vincent Chevalier 
'who worked to Selligue's instructions), while 
the brass-work was made by himself. In the 
Tulley microscope here shown, struts are ap- 
plied, connecting the ease with the body-tube, 
the stage lias mechanical movements, one 
movement being lateral in are, bet no speiial 
line-adjustment was applied, probably because 
the first achromatic objectives made by Tulley 
were low [lowers of such moderate apertures 
that the ordinary rack to the body-tube was 
, found sufficiently sensitive as a focal adjust- 
ment. The substagc is provided with a rotat- 
ing disc of graduated diaphragms ; the draw- 
tube is graduated, evidently for the purpose of 
registering various magnifications, and an 
erecting combination is applied, whence it 
I appear that the intention was to work 
tions. 
A glance through the instrument shows at

achromatic objective, when compared with a 
stride lens object-glass of equal power, for the 
latter could give a tolerable image only when 
a very small diaphragm was applied, whereas 
the former permits the full diameter of the 
combination to be utilised.

: a&gt;ked to supplement with some notes on 
&#8226;,!,. mining exhibits, which are amongst the 
in, si interesting and important of those in the 
. .Idbition. 

Among the mining countries of tlu worl.i. 
Spain occupies a prominent position. At the 
I resent time it is the chief producer of quick- 
silver, and until quite recently was also the 
chief producer of lead; the copper mines ol 
jluelva are the most important in Europe ; 
the iron mines of Bilbao are celebrated for the 
tity of the ores, and for the quality of the 
mi tal produced from them ; its coalfields are 
extensive, and ores of zinc and of other metals 
occur in great abundance. It was, therefore, 
to be expo ted that in a Spanish exhibition 
the exhibits relating to mining would be of 
the greatest interest, and at Barcelona they 
justly occupy a prominent position. 

Thanks to the aid of the Spanish Govern- 
ment, with its corps of trained mining en- 
ers, the rich mineral resources of the 
kingdom are fully shown. It is therefore 
ible for attention to be directed to those 
deposits that await further development, and 
that premise to open u P a lucrative held for 
foreign capital. Indeed, this held seems to 
be inexhaustible, for although Spanish mining 
ancient as to have b en earned on by 
Romans, fresh discoveries of workable 
&#8226;sits are of frequent occurrence. the 
great antiquity of Spanish mining is *eu 
shown by the interesting collection of arcti.co-

Lecture II.&#8212; Delivered March 5, 1888. 

It would demand far more time than is 
placed at my disposal were 1 to endeavour to 
illustrate fully the immense variety of modifica- 
tions in the mechanical and optic al construc- 
tion of the microscope made since the applica- 
tion of achromatism. 1 must, therefore, limit 
myself to a rapid outline of those points which 
have seemed to me most essential. 

In the mechanism of the achromatic micro- 
scope, no part has had more serious attention, 
from those who have sought to improve the 
instrument, than the fine-adjustment. 1 quite 
agree with those microscopists who have said 
that the crucial point of excellence in the 
highest class of microscope is the line-adjust- 
ment. No elaboration of variety of movements, 
no monumental solidity of general form, will 
avail, unless combined with ajgood fine-adjust- 
ment. No microscope should be considered as 
ranking in the first class unless the fine- 
adjustment bears critical testing. 

In estimating the merits of the vast series of 
microscopes of different designs constructed

and Hugh Howell (afterwards Powell 
Lealand), previous to 1S50, that were more 
than equal to any contemporaneous m 
scopy required of them.

of mechanism by which the microscope

collars that seem designed to battle tin 
genuity of the microscopist by the com] 
of their action ; or, again, in the applic

however, one of the first opticians in Enj

achromatic object-glasses, with which he fur-

own name. 

Pritchard's name was so intimately isso- 
ciated with that of Dr. Goring, the inventor ol 
the "Operative Aplanatic Enptseope," thai 
this seems a fitting occasion to mcntii 
instrument, which was elaborately figured in 
their joint production entitled "Micro

of experimenting with different systems of 
line-adjustment, and he must be credited with 
the successful evolution of the long-lever 
system acting on the nose -piece, which 
obtains in the highest class microscope of the 
present day-1 refer to Powell and J.ealandV 
I have here microscopes by him embodying 
all the leading designs of fine-adjustments. 
' onstructed anterior to that system known as 
/entmayer's (i8~n), 

I he earliest microscope I have seen by 
Ross is shown in l-"ig. jo; it has no inclining 
movement. The fine-adjustment consists of a 
long screw passing up the pillar and acting 
on a triangular sheath, within which the; stem 
is applied to move with rack and pinion, the 
top of the stem being hollow, to receive either 
the cross-arm support for the single lens, or 
thclimbofthe compound body. The screw 
is ac tuatcd by a large graduated milled head 
beneath the tripod. The stage is supported by 
extra bracket-pieces on either side, intended 
primarily to avoid the flexure due to the 
pressure of the observer's hands in making 
dissections, and rectangular mechanical move- 
ments are applied, acting diagonally on either 
side of the stem by rather fine screws, so that 
the motions arc very slow. The iast point 
seems to me one in which the mechanism of 
the more modern microscopes has not met 
the requirements for high class work, for 
in tin? great majority of instruments the 
mechanical stage - movements act far too 
rapidly. This defect holds specially with the 
mechanism first devised, I believe, in France, 
but subsequently improved by Tolles, of 
Boston, and W'enham (the inventor of the 
binocular system known as the " W'enham "), 
in which the actuating millcd-head pinions are 
placed vertically to the surface of the stage, by 
which the movements are confined within the 
circumference of the stage. By this modifica- 
tion a complete rotation of the object is 
effected with microscopes of the "Jackson" 
form ; whereas, by the older system, in which 
the pinions project horizontally beyond the 
stage, the rotation is from one side of the 
limb to the other only, /'.&lt;&#8226;., is limited by the 
limb. 

Ross seems to have modified the mil roscope 
above-figured by converting the pillar into a 
tail-piece, retaining the focussing-screw it the 
lower end ; and at the upper end, near the 
pinion, he applied a cradle-joint to incline on a 
pillar and 'ripod. Then (apparently in rivalry 
with James Smith) he adopted a complicated 
system, consisting of a hinged stirrup-piece

encircling the sheath of the body- tube stem, 
lifting up this sheath by a tine screw at 
the bark. He applied a similar mechanism 
to act &lt;&gt;n the nose-piece only, which is known 
as Jackson's system, as shown in Fig. 21, 
which figure is interesting also as proving that

Hugh Powell in applying the fine-adjustment 
to the stage, stimulated, doubtless, by the 1.1, &#8226; 
that the Society of Arts had awarded Powell a 
medal for a very elaborate form of this 
mechanism. From that period (about 1 &gt; ; s &#8226; 
he seems to have definitely worked at the 
long-lever system applied to the nose-piece by 
means of what is known as the cross-arm sup. 
porting the body-tube en the stem, which he 
J brought to great perfection, a perfection ex- 
celled only, so far as my experience inform-, 
me, by Powell and l.ealand. 

The encouragement given to the construc- 
tion of microscopes by the Society of Arts, in 
awarding medals for special points of e\- 
cellence, is a fact of so much interest that 1 
here give a figure of Hugh Powell's micro- 
scope (Fig. 22, p. 1 id;), bearing the date 1 - 1 1 , 
and embodying the fine-adjustment applied 
to the stare. 

As a piece of mechanism this fine-adjust- 
ment is extremely good, the motion is very 
delicate ; but the application to the stage 
cannot be commended from our present point 
of view. The requirements of modern micro- 
scopy are not met adequately by the move- 
ment of the object between the objective and 
the condenser with every touch of the focal 
adjustment. With such an arrangement the 
difficulties of the manipulation generally are 
so great as to be practically intolerable. We 
hove now become so accustomed to the use of 
exactly centered and focussed illumination, 
remaining constant upon the object, by means 
of substage mechanism, allowing modifica- 
: tions in the light to be rapidly made to suit 
the different objectives in use, that \v: could 
hardly test such a microscope as this in a 
manner to fairly estimate its mcchanir.nl 
excellence.

shown in Fig. jj ( p . 1 &#8222;,$) ; it is the first mod. I 
made by Smith and Peck embodying the" Jack- 
son" limb and fine-adjustment. This system ol 
fine-adjustment is now generally admitted to 
be defective; the position so near the nose- 
piece is not favourable- for really critical work 
with our modem objectives of larg.- ap. rture. 
The modification of it I formerly noted upon, 
devised by Dr. H U g U Schroeder. in which the 
actuating milled head is brought away from 
the nose-piece to near the eye-piece, and in 
which slowness of motion was obtained by the 
employment of a diffcrential-screw, does not

I. rhedifferential-screw.as proposed by R&lt; \. ; 
Campbell, has met with much appr 
from Mr. K. M, Nelson, and is regarded by 
.&#9632; cidedly superior to the- usual "( on- 
&#8226; .1 " fine-adju tm.Tit, as employed by 
tnack, Kachet, Zeiss, Leitr, or iicichert. 
m.itly I have not fo"nd the tiiiTercntial- 
w mechanism suflici&#171;ntly well made to 
impress me favourably. 

Various systems of line-adjustment by 
lilting the stage, whii h are mostly revivals of 
what were generally regarded as obsolete 
forms, have been brought forward with more 
&#9632; less pretension recently, and I should hope 
I need not criticise them. 

Regarding the utility or otherwise of a rack- 
[ and centering substage, 1 shall only say 
in my opinion, every microscope with 
wh}ch it is intended to do serious work should 
such n substage; and if the opticians 
would supply an adapter titled with a pivoting 
hragra-carrier, or even a disc of aperture-, 
-.&gt; that objectives could be conveniently used 
ondensers, they would add much to the 
interest of popular microscopy. As it is, I fear 
the great majority of possessors of microscopes 
ire not aware of the immense advantages 
attendant upon the use of condensers, achro- 
matic condensers being, of course, far pre- 
ferable, for it is with them alone that it is really 
practicable to observe objects projected, as it 
were, in the image of the source of light 
ised by the condenser. 
It is, without doubt, highly desirable to have 
1 series of achromatic condensers, of different 
foci, to suit the field of view of objectives of 
rent power. It appears not to be gene- 
rally known that distancing the lamp from the 
microscope will give a considerable range of 
of luminous field, with one and the same 
" lenser. 

As to the general form of microscope thai 1 

&#8226; &gt;st approve for high-class work, 1 have 

en any instrument to compare favour- 

ibly with that of Powell and l.ealand. I do not 

. with certain microscopists&#8212; notably Mr. 

K. M. Nelson&#8212; in considering the tripod base, 

- made by Powell and Lealand, the only really 

good form. I think the projection of the feet 

beyond the vertical plane of the tail-piece, 

&#9632; restricting the free use of the mirror-arms. 

n the instrument is vertical, or only slightly 

ned, is inconvenient. But this is only a 

&#8226; which I mention because I think 

stn -has been put up &gt;n the merits 



. f this or that particular form of construction 
of the base, regardless of the fact that the 
c ifntiitl matters are the absolute steadiness 

ol the instrument combined with the utmost 
freedom for the manipulations&#8212; which matters, 
so far as they are dependent on the form of the 
base, admit of many varieties of design. 

One ambitious form of microscope has been 
recently brought prominently forward, which 
is shown in l-'ig. .'4 (p. 1 i"o). We have here an 
elaboration of mechanical movements and 
illuminating arrangements, the complexity of 
which almost defies comprehension. I had in- 
tended to deal with it critically, but have been 
forced to give it up in despair J rendering 
myself intelligible. Can anyone other than 
the inventor approve of such a design as a 
practical microscope for high-class work t 

Regarding the best form of student's micro- 
scope, the choice seems, upon a cursory 
examination, to be almost unlimited. Hut if 
the student is to be advised to train hi&lt; hand 
and eye in the critical estimation of optical 
images produced by the microscope &#8212; to 
become, in short, an expert in the use of the 
microscope&#8212; then the range of choice is cut 
down to very moderate limits, lie mud have 
an instrument provided (l) with a centering 
sub-stage, without which critical microscopy 
is impossible, for an achromatic condenser is 
an absolute necessity, and such a condenser 
cannot be properly used without centering 
arrangements ; (2) he must have a fairly good 
tine-adjustment, otherwise the waste of time 
in manipulating will be enormous, if, indeed, 
he ever succeeds in Retting the best work out 
of his optical appliances. 

I do not attempt to guide the selection of a 
student's microscope by mentioning that of 
any particular optician. Kfficient instruments 
of this class can be supplied readily by most 
of our opticians, probably more satisfactorily 
than they can be obtained from any foreign 
opticians. This seems to me merely a question 
&#8222;f demand and supply. If the student insists, 
however, upon having the lowest pried instru- 
ment regardless of mechanical efficiency, he 
will doubtless obtain what he seek, imongthe 
importers of low-class microscopes from France 
or Germany&#8212; microscope* made to suit the 
price demanded without reference to their 
efficiency as working instrumi 

As to the objectives, ocular:,, and con- 

&#9632;: 3 that should be in the hand-, of a 

lent, they should be the best his means

Tlic interest which the Society of Arts has taken 
in geology has always been on the side of its direct 
btarngs on agriculture. Long before the study of 
stratigraphical geology had commenced, it had 
offered a premium for a "map of the soils" of 
England. [See ante, p. 393]. At the recent Inter- 
national Geological Congress there were distributed 
copies of an extract (iqt&gt; pp. woodcuts and two 
plates) of the Bulletin de la Societe Beige de 
geologie, de paleontologie et d'hydrologie, giving 
an account of a new portable boring apparatus anil 
the manner of working it, with an illustration from one 
of the sheets of the Belgian Geological Survey 
showing the application of its use. [May 29, 1888, 
by MM. I.. van den Broeck and A. Rutot, Con- 
servators at the Royal Museum of Natural History 
of Belgium ] Prom this it appears it has beer in 
use by some members of the Belgian GeolDgicnl 
Survey for over seven years, though it is little 
known in this country. Messrs. Clement Rei-I 
and A. Strahan.ol" her Majesty's Geological Survey, 
have, however, employed it in the re-survey of the 



Isle of Wight, the map of which has just been &#171;.&#171;&gt;. 
pleted, and they have found the rapidity and cist- 
with which it can be used of great service. With 1: 
they have been enabled to sctth' the uncertain points 
of the geology of the north part of the island, resulting 
in an entire rc-mapping. It has also been employed 
in the re -survey of Norfolk. Its use lor Mbsoil 
mapping is very apparent. The old boring apparatus 
was a cumbersome affair, requiring t;me for it* 
erection ind many men t" work it. Eor deep 
borings, hard rocks, and for cases where 4 " core " \% 
needed, it will, in some form, continue to be employed. 
But the new borer is not intended for deep borings ; 
it is designed for the more rapid and more c.\,n t 
examination of the distribution of soils to the depth 
of a few yards. It re&lt;;uircs but two men, and being 
easily portable, many borings near to one anotlui 
can be taken in a short space of time, and the vai\ . 
ing limits of different subsoils can be thus ascertained 
with an accuracy that has not before been attained. 
The actual borer is fashioned like the end of a worm- 
augur not quite three inches in diameter, and having 
ten turns in it. The upper end is arranged to he 
joined on to a "connecting rod," to which a cross 
handle for rotation is attached. When it is with- 
drawn it is found that although no '&#171; core " is brought 
up, the "worms of the screw" of the augur brin^ 
up, closely compacted, a sample of the soil it ha&gt; 
reached. By means of a series of connecting rods a 
depth of many yards can be readily bored.
